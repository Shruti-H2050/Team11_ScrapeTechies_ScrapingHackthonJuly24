    "recipeDescription": "While at a party where the game of chess was the theme, our flower expert sonal panchmatia was inspired to create this checkerboard of roses. The arrangement is particularly aimed at embellishing a low dining0table sit-down. Complementing the roses in the arrangement is fresh, green asparagus and fragrant lemongrass.",
    "preparationMethod": [
      "Soak the piece of foam well in water before placing it on the tray. Keep the tray at the place where you want to set up the arrangement. Slice the foam to a very low height, in keeping with the height of your low dining-table sit-down.",
      "Depending on their thickness, make four equal-looking bundles of the asparagus, probably using 8 to 10 stems in each. Tie each bundle up with lemongrass and place the bundles along the base of the tray, forming a square. Then tie the four corners with lemongrass to hold the asparagus in place.",
      "Before using the roses, cut the stems to about 6\" to 8\" and leave them in water for about 1/2 hour so that they last longer. Here we have chosen pink and white roses.",
      "Place the roses first in the outer square of the sponge, alternating the white with the pink. Then, in a similar manner, fill up the whole square.",
      "To finish off, use the asparagus ferns to cover up any spaces where the foam is still visible.",
      "If you find asparagus difficult to find, use small drumsticks instead."

Learn how to make Punjabi aam ka achar. To make aam ka achar, combine the mangoes, turmeric powder and 2 tbsp of salt and toss well. Place the mangoes on a sieve, cover with a muslin cloth and place under the sun for 4 to 6 hours. Combine the rest of the ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Add the mangoes and toss well. Bottle the pickle in a sterilized glass jar. Place the pickle under the sun for 4 to 5 days. This aam ka achaar can be stored for upto 1 year. During the mango season in the summer in Punjab, one can see at least two or three earthenware jars full of pickled raw mangoes maturing in the sun outside homes. This typical Punjabi aam ka achar recipe for making mango pickle is most popular in the region. This is a very simple recipe to follow. The combination of fennel seeds, nigella seeds with mustard and other pickling spices is what distinguishes this mango pickle from its equally famous Gujarati counter part. Sun-dried mangoes used in this pickle impart a salty chewy character and also improve the shelf life of the pickle. We recommend the use of mustard oil to make this aam ka achar as it is best suited for making achar. However, you can use any other oil if you wish to. Tips for aam ka achar. 1. Just keep in mind the basics of pickle making a clean sterilized jar and see that there is no moisture in the jar before adding the pickle. 2. Ensure that mustard oil forms a covering layer over the ingredients in the jar. This acts as a preservative and prevents spoilage. 3. We recommend you use a measured quantity of salt for this recipe to get the perfect taste. Also salt acts as a preservative too. 4. During storage, once in a while, take a spoon and mix the pickle in the jar. This is to ensure that the entire pickle is well soaked in oil. 5. Remember never to touch the pickle with your hand. The warmth of your hand may be a reason for spoilage. So use a spoon for serving. Enjoy aam ka achar recipe | Punjabi aam ka achar | mango pickle | with step by step photos.",

    "recipeDescription": "achari dahi bhindi recipe | Punjabi dahi bhindi sabji | achari dahi wali bhindi | okra in achari curd gravy | with amazing 33 images. achari dahi bhindi recipe is a tangy Punjabi bhindi sabzi with the combined sourness of curds and tomatoes, perked up with a wide assortment of seeds and spice powders, which give it a super peppy flavour and aroma too. The name achari comes from the combination of spices used in achari dahi bhindi. The same spices used in achari dahi bhindi are also used to make pickles or achar in Northern India. Bored of having the usual subzi’s? We have got you a unique recipe which is super easy to make and will definitely give a roller coaster ride to your taste buds “achaari dahi bhindi” The ingredients used to make achari dahi bhindi are easily available in every well maintained Indian household pantry. We have made bhindi tastier by giving it a unique twist. We have divided the procedure of making “achari dahi bhindi”. The first step is to prepare the yogurt mixture which needs whisked curds, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander-cumin seed powder to be mixed well. You can also add coriander to the curd mixure if you wish to. The second step is to cook bhindi in mustard oil until cooked and becomes non-sticky. You can deep fry your bhindi if you wish to, we have used sautéing as the cooking method. Lastly, remove bhindi in a plate and keep aside. Take the same pan and add mustard oil which gives the sabzi achari taste. Add fennel seeds, nigella seeds, mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds and asafetida cook. Add ginger, you can skip if you wish to. Add tomatoes and cook. Tomatoes also provide tanginess to the sabzi. Once the tomatoes are cooked, add the curd mixture. Make sure you have lowered the flame or your curd will tend to curdle. Lastly, add the cooked and shallow fried ladies finger and cook. The ladies finger is sliced and shallow-fried before preparing the gravy, so that it has a nice texture and does not end up gooey, which sometimes happens when you add bhindi to a dish without sautéing it properly. I usually use achari bhindi as tiffin treat as it is a dry sabzi and also easy to make. Punjabi dahi bhindi sabji is also now found on the menu of many Indian restaurants. Serve Punjabi achari dahi bhindi sabji hot with any roti or parathas of your choice.

To make Afghani paneer, combine the melon seeds, cashews and poppy seeds in a mixer jar and blend till you get a smooth powder.

Combine the paneer cubes with this powder and marinade, toss gently and keep aside to marinate for 2 hours. Thread 6 pieces of the marinated paneer in each satay stick or a skewer.

Learn how to make ajwain paratha. To make ajwain roti, combine all the ingredients in a deep bowl and mix well. Add enough water (approx. ¾ cup) and knead into a soft dough. Cover the dough with a lid and keep aside for 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 10 equal portions and roll out each portion of the dough into a 175 mm. (7”) diameter circle using a little whole wheat flour for rolling. Heat a non-stick tava (griddle) and cook the roti using a little ghee, till golden brown spots appear on both the sides. Serve immediately. Ajwain has such a tantalising aroma and flavour that it can pep up a dish as a standalone spice! You will realise this when you try this mouth-watering Indian style ajwain chapati. Quick and easy, all it takes is the addition of carom seeds to the flour when making the roti dough, but it makes such a notable difference to the end product. When you cook the ajwain paratha with ghee, the aroma that comes out is so luring that you will want to eat it right off the tava. And you can do that if you choose to – because a cup of curds is all you need to serve with this aromatic roti! Ajwain has many health benefits to its credit as well. On top of the list is its digestive property. It aids in digestion and helps relieve bloating and prevent acidity. Its active compound thymol helps in the secretion of digestive juices in the stomach which prevents indigestion. Thymol also helps to fight bacteria which might cause stomach infection. Make carom seeds paratha, relish them and experience its stomach-friendly benefit. Further this ajwain roti is also a good source of fibre. For this the addition of whole wheat flour bags the credit. Fibre is another nutrient which helps to cleanse the digestive tract by acting as a broom for the system. Fibre being beneficial to manage blood sugar levels and blood cholesterol levels, this roti can be enjoyed by diabetics and heart patients too. Healthy individuals and those aiming weight loss too can restrict the amount of ghee used for cooking and include these rotis in their menu. Tips for ajwain roti. 1. While selecting carom seeds, choose seeds that look crisp and fresh, and have a strong aroma. Check the date of packing and choose a recent lot, as very old stock would have lost much of its aroma. 2. Ensure the dough is soft, so rolling is easier and the rotis turn soft too. 3. Serve it immediately to enjoy its texture, flavour and aroma. Enjoy ajwain roti recipe | ajwain paratha | Indian style ajwain chapati | how to make carom seeds paratha | with step by step photos.",

This unique cake is made with almond flour, coconut, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and honey, unlike run-of-the-mill cakes that are made with maida and sugar. Your body will thank for the goodness of each of these ingredients! Almonds contain a lot of healthy fats, fibre, protein, magnesium and vitamin E. It helps lower blood sugar levels, reduces blood pressure and keeps cholesterol under check. Coconut is made of medium chain triglycerides, which are transported from the intestinal tract to the liver and immediately converted into fuel for your body! Berries are very special too. They are rich in phytochemicals, which are naturally-occurring nutrients that protect our cells from damage. Pumpkin seeds too are a treasure trove of antioxidants. Berries are sweet, but not the kind that scares diabetics. Together with the honey, the berries make the cake pleasantly sweet. If you want it sweeter, you can add a little more honey. This healthy treat is excellent for weight-watchers and athletes as it is rich in healthy fats. It can be relished any time, as a snack or as a dessert. You can also try other healthy treats like Almond Bread , Paneer Tikka , Broccoli and Bajra Snack and Deviled Eggs",

Learn how to make crunchy aloo sev. To make aloo bhujia, combine all the ingredients in a deep bowl, mix well and knead into a soft dough using enough water. Divide the dough into 2 equal portions. Put one portion of the dough in a greased smallest small hole sev \"press\" mould, press it properly and cover it with the lid. Heat the oil in a deep non-stick pan, press out thin strands of the sev in batches into the hot oil and deep-fry on a slow flame till they turn light brown in colour from both the sides. Drain on an absorbent paper. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to deep-fry the remaining sev. Keep aside to cool for 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer the sev into a deep bowl, add the black salt and chaat masala evenly over it and break into pieces while mixing it with your hands. Store in an air-tight container and use as required. Made with a dough of mashed potatoes, besan and rice flour, the aloo bhujia namkeen has a melt-in-the-mouth texture.

If you like this snack, also try other recipes like Methi Puri or Healthy Khakhra Chivda. Tips for aloo bhujia. 1. The potatoes have to be very well mashed. There should be no lumps. If you wish, you can grate them before mashing. 2. Similarly, the besan too has to be free of lumps. Sieve it if necessary. 3. Since we have used mashed potatoes, you will require very little water for kneading the dough. So add water gradually. 4. Always grease the ‘sev press’ before adding the dough it. This ensures smooth falling of strands in oil. 5. The aloo bhujia has to be deep-fried on a slow flame only. Cooking on a high flame might burn the sev quickly. 6. Also remove the sev from the oil, a little before it turns brown. There is always a little after cooking which occurs after removing it from the oil. You will notice this colour change on cooling it slightly. 7. As a variation you can knead dough with mint paste instead of water.

Scrub them with the help of a brush if there is any mud and dirt stuck to it. 2. Add the baby potatoes to the boiling water and cook on a medium flame till the baby potatoes are completely cooked. They should not be very soft or else they will break on cooking. The cooking might take around 18-20 minutes on a medium flame with closed lid. 3. Add the dried mango powder for a pleasant sour (khatta) taste to the marinade. 4. Now add the besan for binding so that the potatoes don’t release water. 5. Mix gently with the help of two spoons and keep aside to marinade for 5 to 7 minutes. This is a very important step as the potatoes need to take on the flavour of the marinade. 6. Cook on a medium flame for 3 to 4 minutes, while stirring occasionally, till they are heated through and get a little browning on them.

It is amazing how common spice powders and an everyday veggie can result in something so tasty when used in the right proportions and cooked the right way! While cooking the potato cubes, do not keep on stirring continuously as they will break and become mushy. Just let them cook for the required time, stirring occasionally, to get a nice texture and taste. We have used mustard oil in this recipe as it adds to the peppy flavour!

With so much flavour ingrained in aloo ki puri that you don’t need any accompaniments to complete it! I love to have my hot masala poori with some chilled curds. The dough of masala poori is reinforced with boiled potatoes and a thoughtful mix of Indian spice powders, which gives it a wonderfully soft texture and energetic flavour. Notes to make perfect aloo ki puri recipe. 1. To make the dough for aloo puri, first boil, peel and grate potatoes. This helps in making soft puri. Also, it is important to grate the potatoes so, there are no lumps and the puri doesn’t tear while rolling. 2. Gradually add water and knead into a stiff dough. It is very important to prepare a stiff dough as that would require less or no use of whole wheat flour while rolling. If you use too much flour while rolling, then while frying this flour particle will get burnt and settle down in oil and later stick to puri while frying. 3. If you are facing difficulty in rolling the pooris then grease the rolling board and rolling pin with some oil to prevent aloo poori from sticking to it. The aloo poori is great to have for breakfast or tea-time. Don’t forget to add a little ghee to the dough because it gives the xxxxmasala poori a good texture and rich flavour to it. Like aloo poori then you can also try other puris like Banana and Rajgira Puri, Spinach Puri and Kand Puri.

Learn how to make Amritsari kulcha. To make aloo kulcha, combine the yeast, sugar and 5 tbsp of lukewarm water in a bowl and mix well. Cover it with a lid and keep aside for 10 minutes. Combine the plain flour, yeast-sugar mixture, curds and salt and in a deep bowl and knead into a soft dough, using enough water. Cover the dough with a lid or damp muslin cloth and keep aside in a warm place for 45 minutes. Add the oil and knead very well. Keep aside. Divide the stuffing into 6 equal portions. Keep aside. Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. Press a portion of the dough flat on a rolling board and roll into a 125 mm. (5”) diameter circle using a little plain flour for rolling. Place a portion of the stuffing in the centre and press it lightly. Bring together all the sides in the centre and seal tightly. Roll again into a circle of 150 mm. (6”) diameter circle with a little plain flour for rolling. Sprinkle ½ tsp of black sesame seeds and 1 tsp of coriander evenly over it and roll again into 200 mm. (8”) diameter circle using a little plain flour for rolling. Repeat steps 3 to 7 to roll 5 more kulchas. Heat a non-stick tava (griddle) and place a kulcha over it with the black sesame seed-coriander side facing downwards. Cook it on one side till it puffs slightly and then turn over. Cook it on the other side till it puffs a little and then roast it on an open flame till it turns golden brown from both the sides. Repeat the steps 9 to 11 to cook 5 more kulchas. Brush each kulcha with a little butter and serve immediately. Dhaba aloo kulcha is a delicious, flavour-packed Indian bread, which is stuffed with a tasty, mildly-tangy potato mixture. A sprinkling of black sesame seeds and chopped coriander on the rolled dough boosts the aroma and flavour of the kulcha manifold. The stuffing with generous use of green chillies, coriander and dried mango powder has the perfect balance of spice and tang in one dish. When cooked on the tava, these ingredients get toasted and give out an awesome aroma. Make sure to brush the Amritsari kulcha with a little butter before serving, to make the taste even richer! You can serve the stuffed kulcha with Paneer Pasanda or Punjabi Chole. And when served for breakfast, these kulchas are paired with a bowl of curd and pickle like Punjabi aam ka achar. Tips for aloo kulcha. 1. The plain flour should be free of lumps. Sieve it if necessary. 2. Ensure that the yeast is not very old nor it is from a packet which has been kept open for too long. 3. Prefer to use the old potatoes for this recipe. The new variety of potatoes tend to be slightly sticky. That would make rolling difficult. 4. You can pressure cook the potatoes or to save time you can cook the potatoes in a microwave. 5. The dough has to be soft, so it is easy to roll. 6. Use plain flour for rolling as required, so the kulcha doesn’t stick to the rolling board. 7. After stuffing the dough, roll it gently so the stuffing does not spill out. 8. After completing the rolling, ensure that the sesame side faces down on the tava. 9. This kulcha is stuffed and slightly thick so it will take some extra time to cook. 10. It has to be served immediately, else it will turn chewy. Enjoy aloo kulcha recipe | Amritsari kulcha | stuffed kulcha | dhaba aloo kulcha | with step by step photos.",

Here, a mixture of potatoes and garlic is coated with a besan batter and deep fried, to get a Spicy Lehsuni Vada, which tastes great when served independently or between a pair of pav buns! I love having Mumbai roadside batata vada with sukhi lehsun chutney on the small crowded street of Mumbai leading to the train station. The Mumbai roadside batata vada is served hot on a paper plate with loads of spicy dry garlic chutney. The strong flavour of garlic transforms the soft and soothing potato into an exciting aloo lehsun vada snack! Notes on aloo lehsun vada 1. Add 1 tbsp hot oil. The addition of hot oil makes the besan covering crispy on frying. 2. Add ½ cup of water. Be careful while adding water, the batter should not be very runny or thick. It should be just enough to coat the aloo balls. 3. Using a whisk, mix well to make a lump-free, smooth batter. Keep aside. 4. Heat the oil in a deep non-stick pan for frying the spicy vada. Maintain the temperature of oil. Very high heat browns the batata vada from outside very fast and the besan covering remains uncooked. If you let the temperature too low then they will turn greasy. 5. Dip each Mumbai roadside batata vada in the prepared batter and deep-fry a few vadas in hot oil till they turn golden brown in colour from all the sides. If you deep-fry all of them together then it will reduce the temperature of oil very quickly and will also stick to each other. aloo lehsun vada can be served as a starter or evening snack with tea . Add to the garlicky notes by serving it with sukhi lehsuni chutney. It is important to serve aloo lehsun vada immediately because the top layer of besan tends to become thick after some time – it must be served immediately to relish the nice crispy texture.

Yet, every time you taste it, potatoes with fenugreek leaves feels exotic, with the softness of potatoes and the pleasing bitterness of methi. You will find that this aloo methi dry sabzi is made with everyday ingredients in Indian kitchens like potatoes, methi, ginger, garlic, cumin seeds and red chillies. The rich aroma and flavour of aloo methi makes you eat an extra chapati or two. I would like to share some important tips to make the perfect Punjabi aloo methi. Take a deep bowl and put the chopped methi leaves into it. Sprinkle a little salt over the methi leaves and mix well. Keep this aside for 15 minutes. As fenugreek is a very bitter vegetable, adding salt over it removes the bitterness in the form of water. This makes the fenugreek much less bitter in the aloo methi sabzi. 2. Cooking the potatoes for long makes them a little crisp and gives them an appetising brownish colour. It also allows the potatoes to imbibe the flavours of the garlic, green chillies and ginger really well in aloo methi. We often make aloo methi sabzi with baby potatoes at home, however our recipe uses regular potatoes. Aside from aloo methi try other sabzi combos with methi like Methi Palak Paneer Subzi, Methi Papad and Methi Mutter Pasanda.

Dip each round ball in the plain flour-water mixture and lightly roll them in bread crumbs in such a way that the balls are evenly coated from all the sides. Heat the oil in a kadhai and deep-fry the balls till they are golden brown in colour from all the sides. Drain on absorbent paper. Serve aloo methi tikki immediately with green chutney.

This potato snack recipe is further enhanced with common spice powders like garam masala, turmeric powder and dried mango powder along with other effective ingredients like cumin seeds, ginger, onions, and so on. This aloo methi tikki has a slightly crispy outer covering because of the use of maida water mixture along with bread crumbs. Once you bite into it, you will enjoy its unique soft texture from within. Serve it fresh with green chutney or a tangy curd dip like Achari Dip, Tahini Dip, Dill Dip or Spiced Tandoori Dip. Tips for aloo methi tikki. 1. While we recommend the use of finely chopped green chillies and ginger for this snack, if you wish you can replace it with ginger green chilli paste. 2.

Amlas (Indian gooseberries) are a major ingredient in several herbal tonics as they are reputed to be good for the liver, eyes and stomach. Amlas are the richest known source of Vitamin C. Amlas are abundantly available during the winter months. I actually buy a large quantity of this fruit each year to make amla ka murraba. Whole amlas simmered in a cardamom and saffron flavoured syrup is one of my personal favourites. There are several traditional recipes for making this amla murraba. Some soak the amlas in alum (phitkari) overnight whilst others sun-dry amlas. I find it easiest to cook the amlas in boiling water to get rid of all its bitter juices. The entire process takes about 2 to 3 days. First the amlas are simmered in a thin sugar syrup and left aside for 2 days during which the amlas slowly and gradually soak in the syrup. On the third day, the syrup is boiled again along with the flavouring to a thick honey like consistency and the amlas are added. The thick syrup helps in the preservation of the amla murraba and also complements the sharp and acidic amla taste. When preserved for a long period of time, the syrup of the amla ka murraba turns to a dark brown to an almost black colour and takes in all the goodness of the amlas.

    "recipeDescription": "angoor ka sharbat recipe | Mughlai black grape drink | healthy kale angoor ka ras | angoor juice | with 12 amazing images. Indian black grape juice, also known as kale angoor ka ras or karehal ka juice, offers a distinctive taste and experience different from typical grape juices. Here\u0027s a description: A beautiful deep purple color due to the anthocyanin pigments in black grapes. While green grapes abound in vitamin C as a source of antioxidants, the black variety also is rich in ‘anthocyanins’ that give them their colour. Both these antioxidants are present in highest amounts just beneath the skin. Thus it is advisable to wash the grapes thoroughly and enjoy them. A rich and intense aroma with notes of ripe black grapes, sometimes carrying hints of earthiness or spice depending on the variety and regional variations. To make angoor ka sharbat, in a mixer put the grapes. Add cumin seeds powder, lemon juice and grated ginger, 1/2 cups water and 24 ice cubes. Blend into a smooth and creamy mixture. Pour into 4 individual glasses. Serve angoor ka sharbat chilled garnished with mint leaves. Main ingredients for Mughlai black grape drink 1. black grapes or grapes. grapes provide the dominant sweetness. The flavonoid quercetin found in grapes helps to reduce the risk of heart diseases and prevents the onset of stroke. Resveratrol is another antioxidant that grapes possess. 2. lemon juice. Grapes are naturally sweet, and even grape juice can be quite sugary. A touch of lemon juice adds a touch of acidity, which can help cut through the sweetness and create a more balanced flavor profile. This is particularly useful when using sweeter grape varieties for the juice. Lemon juice can introduce additional citrusy notes that complement the flavors of the grapes and add complexity to the juice. Lemon is a very good source of vitamin C and thus helps in the production of white blood cells and antibodies in the blood which attacks invading microorganisms, prevents infection and builds immunity. With not too high a sodium count to its credit coupled with good levels of potassium (5.7% per cup), grapes in kale angoor ka ras contain the necessary minerals to maintain high blood pressure. Low intakes of potassiumhave often been linked to poor control of blood pressure and strokes. Pro tips for kale angoor ka ras. 1. Add 1/2 tsp grated ginger (adrak). Grated ginger is often added to grape juice to enhance its flavor and provide additional health benefits. The spicy, pungent, and slightly sweet flavor of ginger complements the natural sweetness of grape juice, creating a delicious and complex flavor profile. Ginger is an effective cure for congestion, sore throat, cold and cough. 2. Add 3/4th tsp cumin seeds (jeera) powder. Cumin powder has a warm, earthy, and slightly citrusy aroma and flavor profile. While its use in this context might be unconventional, it could potentially complement the sweetness and tartness of the grapes and add a unique savory depth to the juice. The most common benefit of jeera known to many is to soothe the stomach, intestine and the entire digestive tract. Cumin seeds are apparently a very good source of iron.

Put a few saffron strands in the milk. When you add saffron to warm liquid, in this case milk, it releases flavor and a beautiful yellow color. 2. Mix well and keep aside till you make the anjeer basundi. No Indian sweet is complete without the addition of a spice like saffron. 3. Pour the full fat milk in a deep non-stick pan. The important thing to remember here is that the milk has to be full fat. The process of making basundi includes thickening the milk over a slow flame and this will only be possible with full fat milk. This process is similar to that of Rabdi. 4. Reduce the heat to a low-medium flame and cook for 15 to 17 minutes, while stirring occasionally and while scrapping the sides of the pan. This step is essential to the anjeer basundi recipe because the malai stuck to the pan provides the thickness and consistency we desire in the basundi.5. Once the milk is reduced by half, add the anjeer pieces. Only dried figs should be used to make the basundi as fresh figs will result in the milk curdling. You can also try other Basundi recipes like the Basundi or Pineapple Basundi. Enjoy how to make anjeer basundi recipe | easy anjeer basundi | with detailed step by step photos.",

The sweet and slightly nutty flavor of the figs adds a unique twist to the anjeer smoothie, making it a refreshing and satisfying drink. anjeer smoothie is not only tasty but also packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making it a healthy choice for a snack or breakfast option.

Options to add for anjeer smoothie For kids you can add 3/4 cup coarsely crushed sweet biscuits (Parle-G). 1 cup vanilla ice-cream to get a richer taste. You can use 1 cup chilled milk instead of 1 cup low fat curds (dahi) or curd (dahi). Key ingredients of anjeer smoothie. 1. Soaked dried figs (anjeer). Dried figs are a concentrated source of natural sugars, offering sweetness to the smoothie without needing refined sugar or artificial sweeteners. This makes them a healthy alternative for those seeking a naturally sweet drink. Anjeer has a distinct flavor profile that combines sweetness with a subtle earthy and nutty taste. 2. Bananas are naturally sweet and have a creamy texture, making them a perfect base for smoothies. They add sweetness to balance the slightly tart or earthy flavor of dried figs without needing refined sugar. Additionally, the bananas help create a thick and creamy consistency, improving the mouthfeel of the smoothie. Pro tips for anjeer smoothie. 1. Add 1 cup low fat curds (dahi). Curd adds a creamy texture and thickness to the smoothie, making it more satisfying and enjoyable to drink. This is particularly beneficial for anjeer smoothies, as dried figs can have a slightly chewy texture. Curd introduces a subtle tangy flavor to the smoothie, which helps to balance the sweetness of the dried figs and other added ingredients like honey. 2. Add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Vanilla extract adds a subtle sweetness and a touch of complex vanilla aroma that complements the fig flavor without overpowering it. Vanilla extract is a potent flavoring, so a small amount (usually 1/2 teaspoon or less) is typically used in anjeer smoothies. Too much vanilla extract can overpower the delicate flavor of the figs.

Appam is a tasty white Indian pancake crisp on the sides with a soft centre. appam or palappam are a famous Kerala breakfast made from raw rice, coconut milk, dry yeast and a little bit of sugar. Appam is a famous dish from the Keralite repertoire of South Indian cooking. This Kerala appam is an easy-to-make, instant version of the otherwise tough-to-make dish. Since yeast is used, the batter need not be fermented for long unlike the traditional version. Notes on appam recipe. 1. The batter should rise, keep it in a warm place and it always depends on the weather conditions also. The batter will take time to rise if the weather outside is cold. The centre of the appam will always be thick. 2. Make sure the kadhai is hot when you make the appams. If the kadhai is not hot enough the batter will bounce back to the centre. 3. Dry yeast also should be dissolved and mixed well in the batter. 4. You need to use raw rice also known as (Kaccha chawal) in hindi which is readily available in any grocery store. And also see that you use thick coconut milk as you are adding warm water while grinding the rice. More water will split when you put in the appamchatty.

    "recipeDescription": "appam recipe | appam Kerala Recipe | South Indian appam with yeast | with 35 amazing images. appam, a South Indian delicacy, is a thin, bowl-shaped pancake boasting a unique textural contrast. Its crisp, lacy edges give way to a soft and fluffy center, creating a delightful experience with every bite. Made with fermented rice flour and coconut milk, appam boasts a subtle sweet and nutty flavor that compliments savory dishes perfectly. The addition of spices like cardamom can add a touch of warmth, while the naturally gluten-free nature of appam makes it a versatile option for various dietary needs. Whether enjoyed plain or with chutneys, vegetables, or even an egg, appam offers a delicious and satisfying journey for your taste buds. appam has various names depending on the region in India and Sri Lanka where it is made. Here are some of the most common alternatives: India: • Kerala: • Unniappam (small appam) • Neyyappam (appam cooked in ghee) • Kuzhappam (cooked in a kuzhi or cavity) • Ganapathi appam • Koottappam (a pile of appams) • Tamil Nadu : • Kuzhi paniyaram • Karnataka : • Appe • Kajjaya (in Coorg region) • Konkani community (Karnataka): • Mulik (made with semolina, jackfruit or banana) • Sri Lanka : • Aappa These names might have slight variations in pronunciation based on local dialects. Additionally, some regional variations of appam might have specific names depending on the ingredients or cooking methods used. Main ingredients of appam. In a mixer put 2 cups of uncooked rice (chawal), soaked for 4 to 5 hours and drained. Rice flour forms the base of appam batter, providing structure and body to the thin pancake. The starch in the rice flour helps the batter hold its shape and allows for the characteristic bowl-like shape of appam to form during cooking. Add 1 cup coconut milk (nariyal ka doodh). Coconut milk is naturally rich in fats, which contribute to a soft and fluffy texture in the appam batter. This creates a pleasing contrast to the crispy exterior formed during cooking. Appam batter traditionally avoids gluten-containing flours like wheat. Coconut milk provides a binding agent, allowing the batter to hold its shape and rise while remaining gluten-free. Pro tips for appam. 1. To make yeast mixture in a bowl put 1/2 tsp instant dry yeast. Instant dry yeast is generally more readily available in stores compared to toddy (palm wine), which was traditionally used as a leavening agent in appam. This makes it a convenient option for home cooks. Instant dry yeast has a longer shelf life compared to fresh toddy, which needs to be used within a short period. Instant dry yeast performs well across a wider range of temperatures, which can be helpful in regions with cooler climates where toddy fermentation might be less efficient. 2. Add ½ cup of warm water. Warm water, ideally between 100°F and 110°F (37°C and 43°C), is added to dry yeast in making appam. Appam batter often includes sugar, toddy (palm wine), or other ingredients. Warm water can help dissolve these components more efficiently, leading to a smoother batter and better distribution of flavors. Serve appam with milagai podi powder, coconut chutney , sambar and coconut stew. Enjoy appam recipe | appam Kerala Recipe | South Indian appam with yeast | with step by step photos.",

These pancakes are made without eggs, using a combination of buckwheat flour, chopped apples, curd, plant-based milk, and a few pantry staples to create a flavorful and satisfying meal. Buckwheat flour, the main ingredient in these pancakes, adds a unique nutty taste and a hearty texture that sets them apart from regular pancakes. Buckwheat is a gluten-free whole grain that is rich in nutrients like fiber, protein, and essential minerals, making it a wholesome choice for a balanced gluten free Indian breakfast. Chopped apples are incorporated into the pancake batter, providing natural sweetness, moisture, and a hint of tartness that complements the earthy flavor of buckwheat. The combination of apples and buckwheat creates a harmonious blend of flavors and textures, resulting in pancakes that are both comforting and nutritious. To bind the ingredients together in the absence of eggs, a mixture of plant-based milk (such as almond milk or oat milk) and a bit of curd is used. This helps create a smooth and pourable batter that cooks up into fluffy and golden-brown pancakes on the griddle. eggless buckwheat apple pancakes are versatile and can be customized to suit individual preferences. They can be served with a drizzle of maple syrup, a dollop of yogurt, a sprinkle of cinnamon, or a handful of chopped nuts for added crunch and flavor. The pancakes can also be topped with additional apple slices or a fruit compote for a fresh and fruity twist. These eggless apple buckwheat pancakes are not only a delicious and wholesome breakfast option but also a great way to incorporate whole grains and fruits into your diet.

With the goodness of buckwheat, the sweetness of apples, and the simplicity of eggless preparation, these pancakes are sure to become a favorite among those seeking a wholesome and delicious morning meal. Pro tips for eggless apple buckwheat pancakes. 1. Add 2 tsp baking powder. Baking powder is used in buckwheat apple pancakes for the same reason it\u0027s used in many baked goods: to make them rise and become fluffy. Properly risen pancakes look thicker and more appetizing. 2. Add 2 tbsp curds or 1 egg. Eggs are a common ingredient in pancakes because they help bind the dry and wet ingredients together, creating a cohesive batter and holding the pancake\u0027s shape during cooking. Since these are eggless pancakes, curds act as a substitute binder. Curds contain protein that helps bind the ingredients and creates a structure similar to what eggs would provide.

Instead of adding cinnamon powder to the jam, you may also choose to dip a stick of cinnamon into the jam while it is still hot, and lid the jar for a while, allowing the flavour to ooze in naturally and mildly. The coarse texture, which results from grating rather than blending the apples, is a specialty of this jam. But, of course, the best part is that it can be prepared in a jiffy using the microwave oven, so you can prepare fresh jam anytime you wish to!",

    "recipeDescription": "lemon apple juice recipe | lemon and apple juice benefits | apple lemon cooler | how to make apple and lemon juice | lemon apple juice is a healthy, refreshing and energising Indian potion for early morning. Learn how to make apple and lemon juice. To make lemon apple juice, add the apple cubes a few at a time in the juicer. Add the lemon juice and mix well. Add some crushed ice in 2 individual glasses and pour equal quantities of the juice over it. Serve apple lemon cooler immediately. “An apple a day keeps the doctor away”, says the proverb and it\u0027s almost true. Apples are a storehouse of fibre which helps to keep your digestive tract healthy. Apples contain an enzyme called \u0027polyphenolase\u0027, which when comes in contact with oxygen produces coloured phenolic compounds that impart undesirable brown colour to the pieces. However, some amount of fibre is lost in the process of juicing. Hence we recommend that you use a high quality blender and not strain the juice, to benefit the most from apple lemon cooler. A dash of lime cuts through the sweetness perfectly and zips up the flavour of this apple and lemon juice. It also adds enough vitamin C. This key nutrient is important to build immunity and fight diseases. With 108 calories per glass, this sugar free nourishing drink is a great addition to your breakfast. From kids to adults to senior citizens and even pregnant women all can indulge into this apple and lemon juice. You can serve it to kids after play time when they need an energy boost and make up for their water requirement too! Tips for lemon apple juice. 1. To prevent the apple from browning, cut the apples just before juicing or simply squeeze lemon juice over the pieces. 2. Use unpeeled apples preferably, as much of the fibre lies beneath the skin of the fruits. 3. Serve it immediately to benefit from the vitamin C from lemon juice. This is because vitamin C is a volatile nutrient and some of it is lost on exposure to air. 4. We do not recommend this juice for diabetics as it can be a dose of excess carbs at a time.

While this combo has proved its worth in many forms ranging from pies to cakes, here we have harnessed it to make a delightfully tasty but easy dessert, which is acceptable for diabetics too! We have used whole wheat flour instead of maida and cornflour to make the pancakes, as these refined flours will raise blood sugar levels rapidly. The healthy pancakes are then stuffed with fibre-rich apples, tinged with cinnamon and a dash of lemon. Cinnamon, apart from giving the Apple Pancake an awesome flavour, is also very helpful in controlling blood sugar levels. Diabetics can enjoy the Apple Pancake as a dessert, occasionally. Do try other desserts like Coffee Mousse or Soya Chocolate Pancakes with Strawberry Sauce .",

In fact all you need is whole wheat flour, ghee, sugar, cardamom and almonds to garnish the Gujarati atta ka sheera. I consider whole wheat sheera one of the easiest Gujarati sweets to make. To make atta ka sheera, heat ghee in a non-stick kadai. When the ghee melts, add whole wheat flour. Stir continuously so no lumps form and the flour cooks evenly. Sauté on a medium flame for 2 to 3 minutes or till it turns brown in colour and the ghee separates. After roasting for 5 to 7 minutes, the mixture will turn golden brown indicating wheat flour has cooked completely. Add sugar. Add cardamom powder to provide a nice fragrance to whole wheat sheera recipe. Add ¾ cup of water. Mix well till the wheat flour absorbs all the water. Cook on a low flame for another 2 to 3 minutes and our gehun nu sheera is ready. Just note a few simple points, and success is assured to make the perfect atta ka sheera. 1. Do not compromise on the quantity of ghee else the atta halwa will become sticky and not yield the perfect taste and texture. 2. It is important to roast the gehun ka atta on a low flame very well otherwise, you may get raw taste if under roasted or burnt flavour if over roasted. 3. Add cardamom powder to provide a nice fragrance to whole wheat sheera recipe. Gujarati atta ka sheera is a quick dessert and requires far less effort as compared to Moong Dal Sheera and Badam ka Sheera. If you have a very sweet tooth, you can add two more tablespoons of sugar.

Learn how to make Rajasthani malpua. To make atte ka malpua, combine the sugar and 1 cup of water in a deep non-stick pan and cook on a medium flame for 3 minutes, while stirring continuously. Transfer the mixture into a deep bowl and allow it to cool completely. Once cooled, add the crushed peppercorns, fennel seeds, whole wheat flour and ¼ cup of water and mix well using a whisk. Keep aside. Heat the ghee in a broad non-stick pan, pour a ladleful of the mixture into the hot ghee 1 at a time and deep-fry on a high flame till golden brown in colour from all the sides. Repeat step 4 to make 14 more malpuas. Serve immediately. Rajasthani malpua is just what you need to warm your heart on a cold, winter’s day. It is not surprising then that this is a traditional favourite in Rajasthani households, especially during the unrelenting winter days. You will also find it astonishing that with the use of minimal ingredients, which are easily available in our house, can be crafted into such an irresistible dessert. The smell of sugary, spicy whole wheat batter deep-frying in ghee, especially the prominent accents of fennel and pepper, is enough to make one drool! Remember that you have to only melt the sugar in water and make a sugar syrup. We do not need one or two thread consistency sugar syrup in this mithai. So cook the sugar for the said time only. This Indian sweet recipe is often teamed up with rabdi – another Indian sweet made by simmering milk till it thickens and is made sweet by the addition of sugar. Further, elaichi powder and nuts are made to give it a richer flavour and taste. Tips for atte ka malpua. 1. At step 1, keep stirring the sugar syrup continuously so as to avoid it sticking to the pan. 2. After making the batter, ensure it is lump free. 3. To get perfectly round and crispy malpuas, make sure the ghee is piping hot before ladling the batter into it.

Rare is the wedding or festive menu that does not include avial! Sadya, a traditional feast of Kerala always includes avail which is served with other vegetables , rice, pickles spread out on a plantain leaf. I share a time-honored method of making a delicious avial with mixed vegetables, fresh coconut, curry leaves, coconut oil and curd ( yogurt, dahi). The key to making excellent avial is to pay equal attention to the visual appeal – vegetables with contrasting colours such as carrot, beans, pumpkin etc are chosen, sliced evenly into thin 1 inch long pieces, and cooked to a crunchy consistency. If you’ve done this, you’ve crossed half the bridge successfully! Serve avial with steamed rice, sambar, pickle for a complete South Indian meal. pro tips for avial recipe. 1. Using coconut oil to cook South Indian food is a healthier option than processed seed oil. 2. You can mix and match the vegetables used for making avail based on what is in your kitchen and in season. 3. We first half cooked drumsticks ( Saijan ki phalli ) as they take the longest time to cook and then added all the vegetables. 4.

    "recipeDescription": "avocado almond milk smoothie recipe | avocado smoothie | healthy Indian avocado banana milk vegan smoothie | with 10 amazing images. avocado almond milk smoothie is a healthy smoothie for vegans also. Learn how to make healthy Indian avocado banana milk smoothie. Avocado is used as a substitute for butter and cream, with good reason. It has a neutral flavour and a super creamy consistency. This also makes it a wonderful addition to smoothies such as avocado almond milk smoothie! You get a nice, creamy effect as if you have made the smoothie with ice-cream! Here, an amazing combo of chopped avocado and almond milk is teamed with bananas to get a luscious, naturally sweet avocado almond milk smoothie. We have used maple syrup instead of honey to make the avocado almond milk smoothie suitable for vegans too. But, if you are not vegan you can also use honey instead. Avocado is a great source of vitamin C, vitamin A and some B vitamins along with calcium and magnesium. It helps in maintaining skin health, reduces the risk of heart diseases and cancer and keeps your eyes healthy. Note : Can\u0027t get enough almond milk? Don\u0027t worry! Any other milk will blend in perfectly for a satisfying treat. You can adjust the amount of avocado based on your desired consistency and nutritional needs. More avocado equals thicker texture and higher fat content, while less brings a lighter touch. Raw avocado adds a fresh, creamy feel. Avocados pair beautifully with almost any fruit, vegetable, and spice combination in a smoothie. Pro tips for avocado almond milk smoothie. 1. in a mixer put 3/4 cup roughly chopped avocado. Avocados have a magical ability to transform smoothies into lusciously creamy combinations. Avocados are rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) which help to manage the cholesterol levels within normal limits. They also help reduce inflammation in the body and prevent blockage of arteries – one of the main reasons for heart attacks. 2. Add readymade unsweetened almond milk. Almond milk, naturally smooth and slightly sweet, provides the perfect base for blending with avocado. It creates a luxuriously creamy texture, like a dairy-free milkshake, without the heaviness of traditional milk. 3. Add roughly chopped frozen bananas. Bananas, when blended, naturally create a luxurious creamy texture that perfectly complements the richness of avocado and the nuttiness of almond milk. Banana is high in potassium. Potassium helps normalize the heartbeat and regulates the body\u0027s water balance. Bananas have low sodium content and high potassium content, and contribute to making it an ideal fruit for hypertensives. 4. Add maple syrup or honey. Both add sweetness and enhance the flavor of the smoothie. Honey is the traditional choice, but you can use maple syrup for a vegan option. While avocados and almonds contribute some natural sweetness, honey can amplify it, creating a more balanced and enjoyable flavor profile. It elevates the smoothie from subtle to delightfully sweet, especially if your avocados are not at peak ripeness.

Thereafter, the rice is flavoured with a sesame and vinegar dressing, layered with veggies – in this case avocados and cucumber, rolled and cut up tactfully. To make this sushi, make sure you use ripe avocados and take care while cutting them, to make neat strips without mashing.

    "recipeDescription": "A creamy smoothie with a soothing taste, the Avocado Coconut Milk Vegan Smoothie is a treasure-trove of nutrients too. Coconut Milk and avocadoes are both ingredients with mellow flavours and creamy consistencies, so they team up very well. We have combined these with bananas, to get a nice fruity sweetness and to increase the luscious mouth-feel of the smoothie further. While we have used vegan-friendly maple syrup as a sweetener, you can also use honey if you are not vegan. The antioxidants and fibre in avocado helps to keep away heart diseases, diabetes and cancer. Coconut and avocado are both good sources of mono unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), which promote overall health of body cells. Loaded with such nutritious ingredients, this smoothie makes a satiating, tasty and healthy snack. You can make it and store in the fridge for around four hours. Keep some handy to consume when you are hungry, instead of unhealthy deep-fried and heavily-processed snacks. You can also try other smoothies like Blueberry Coconut Water Smoothie, 3 Ingredient Smoothie or Avocado Almond Milk Vegan Smoothie .",

An avocado spinach smoothie made with almond milk is a nutritious and creamy beverage that combines the richness of avocado, the earthy flavor of spinach, and the nutty sweetness of almond milk, vanilla extract, maple syrup and sea salt. The addition of almond milk not only enhances the creaminess of the avocado spinach smoothie but also adds a subtle nutty flavor. This smoothie is sweetened with a touch of honey. The avocado spinach smoothie has a vibrant green color and a velvety texture. It is not only delicious but also packed with nutrients, including healthy fats from the avocado, vitamins and minerals from the spinach, and the benefits of almond milk, such as being a good source of vitamin E and low in calories. We have used maple syrup instead of honey to make the avocado spinach almond milk smoothie suitable for vegans too. But, if you are not vegan you can also use honey instead. This avocado spinach smoothie is a popular choice for a nutritious breakfast or a post-workout snack and is a great way to incorporate more greens into your diet. The avocado spinach vegan smoothie lasts for upto 5 hours in the refrigerator. Note : Can\u0027t get enough almond milk? Don\u0027t worry! Any other milk will blend in perfectly for a satisfying treat. You can adjust the amount of avocado based on your desired consistency and nutritional needs. More avocado equals thicker texture and higher fat content, while less brings a lighter touch. Raw avocado adds a fresh, creamy feel. Avocados pair beautifully with almost any fruit, vegetable, and spice combination in a smoothie. Pro tips for avocado spinach smoothie. 1. In a mixer put chopped ripe avocado. Avocados have a magical ability to transform smoothies into lusciously creamy combinations. Avocados are rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) which help to manage the cholesterol levels within normal limits. They also help reduce inflammation in the body and prevent blockage of arteries – one of the main reasons for heart attacks. 2. Add roughly chopped spinach (palak). Spinach helps create a luxuriously creamy texture. When blended with avocado, it adds thickness and body, transforming the smoothie into a satisfying drink rather than a thin juice. Spinach is one of the richest plant sources of iron and it should be part of a healthy diet for everyone. Spinach is good for the heart, diabetics and eyes. 3. Add readymade unsweetened almond milk. Almond milk, naturally smooth and slightly sweet, provides the perfect base for blending with avocado. It creates a luxuriously creamy texture, like a dairy-free milkshake, without the heaviness of traditional milk. See how to make homemade almond milk.
