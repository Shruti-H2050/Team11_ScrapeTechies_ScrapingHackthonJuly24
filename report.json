The arrangement is particularly aimed at embellishing a low dining0table sit-down. Complementing the roses in the arrangement is fresh, green asparagus and fragrant lemongrass.",
    "preparationMethod": [
      "Soak the piece of foam well in water before placing it on the tray. Keep the tray at the place where you want to set up the arrangement. Slice the foam to a very low height, in keeping with the height of your low dining-table sit-down.",
      "Depending on their thickness, make four equal-looking bundles of the asparagus, probably using 8 to 10 stems in each. Tie each bundle up with lemongrass and place the bundles along the base of the tray, forming a square. Then tie the four corners with lemongrass to hold the asparagus in place.",
      "Before using the roses, cut the stems to about 6\" to 8\" and leave them in water for about 1/2 hour so that they last longer. Here we have chosen pink and white roses.",
      "Place the roses first in the outer square of the sponge, alternating the white with the pink. Then, in a similar manner, fill up the whole square.",
      "To finish off, use the asparagus ferns to cover up any spaces where the foam is still visible.",
      "If you find asparagus difficult to find, use small drumsticks instead."

Learn how to make Punjabi aam ka achar. To make aam ka achar, combine the mangoes, turmeric powder and 2 tbsp of salt and toss well. Place the mangoes on a sieve, cover with a muslin cloth and place under the sun for 4 to 6 hours. Combine the rest of the ingredients in a bowl and mix well. Add the mangoes and toss well. Bottle the pickle in a sterilized glass jar. Place the pickle under the sun for 4 to 5 days. This aam ka achaar can be stored for upto 1 year. During the mango season in the summer in Punjab, one can see at least two or three earthenware jars full of pickled raw mangoes maturing in the sun outside homes. This typical Punjabi aam ka achar recipe for making mango pickle is most popular in the region. This is a very simple recipe to follow. The combination of fennel seeds, nigella seeds with mustard and other pickling spices is what distinguishes this mango pickle from its equally famous Gujarati counter part. Sun-dried mangoes used in this pickle impart a salty chewy character and also improve the shelf life of the pickle. We recommend the use of mustard oil to make this aam ka achar as it is best suited for making achar. However, you can use any other oil if you wish to. Tips for aam ka achar. 1. Just keep in mind the basics of pickle making a clean sterilized jar and see that there is no moisture in the jar before adding the pickle. 2. Ensure that mustard oil forms a covering layer over the ingredients in the jar. This acts as a preservative and prevents spoilage. 3. We recommend you use a measured quantity of salt for this recipe to get the perfect taste. Also salt acts as a preservative too. 4. During storage, once in a while, take a spoon and mix the pickle in the jar. This is to ensure that the entire pickle is well soaked in oil. 5. Remember never to touch the pickle with your hand. The warmth of your hand may be a reason for spoilage. So use a spoon for serving. Enjoy aam ka achar recipe | Punjabi aam ka achar | mango pickle | with step by step photos.",

Tips for Indian achari paneer tikka. 1. 18. If you are making hung curd at home, ensure that you tie and hang the curd for at least an hour to get a perfect thick curd. Watery curd might render the marinade to be thin and difficult to coat the tikkas. 2. Use only fresh paneer, for best results and perfect smooth texture. 3. Do not overcook the tikkas, else the paneer might become chewy.
