The milagai podi is mixed with sesame oil or melted ghee and served with Idlis or dosas. A quick-fix accompaniment for idlis and dosas, milagai podi is a lip-smacking chutney powder made of roasted urad and red chillies combined with a little sesame for aroma and jaggery to highlight the flavours. In South Indian homes and restaurants, milagai podi is served irrespective of whether or not there are other accompaniments. Most people like to have at least one idli or dosa with this all-time favourite! Idlis and dosas are also smeared with milagai podi mixture when they are packed for Indian travel food idlis, dosas. This rules out the need for other accompaniments and also keeps the idli milagai podi moist for a long time. You can vary the amount of red chillies depending on how spicy you like it. I would like to share some important tips to make the perfect idli milagai podi. 1. To get the best result, ensure the lentils and spices are fresh and clean them for any stones before you start roasting. We have dry-roasted everything, if you like you can use oil for roasting but, it will decrease the shelf life of the milagai podi powder. 2. Many people even add sesame seeds (black or white) to the milagai podi chutney, adding it depends upon you. 3. We have made use of Kashmiri red chillies to make milagai podi , but you can also use pandi chillies or byadagi chillies. Also, the quantity can be increased or decreased depending upon the spice level you can handle. 4. Blend Idli Podi to a slightly coarse powder. Do not grind at a stretch or it will form a lumpy mass. Grind it in intervals to get a nice coarse powder but, if you like fine, then grind till smooth.

It is so tasty that you can even serve idli upma to guests. Ingredients for idli upma are leftover idlis , tomatoes, onions, green peas, carrots, peanut oil to cook and some Indian spices. I find this idli upma far more healthier than plain idli. Let’s see why we call this a healthy idli upma? Idli is a perfect combination of urad dal and par boiled rice which make it a complete protein. A cereal pulse combo like in the case of Idli ( par boiled rice and urad dal) would serve as a complete protein comprising of all the 9 essential amino acids. However idlis are high in carbs. So in idli upma recipe we are adding lots of fibre through high quality vegetables like carrots, onions, green peas and tomatoes to make this recipe even healthier. Even better, we have cooked the idlis in peanut oil which has the highest amount of MUFA (around 49%) amongst most Indian common cooking oils. So use the peanut oil if you want to be healthy and I would suggest to do lots of your Indian cooking in peanut oil or coconut oil. Notes on idli upma recipe. 1. If you are making use of fresh idlis, then cool them completely and then crumble to avoid them getting completely mashed. Idlis refrigerated for 5-6 hours or overnight give the best results. 2. The idli upma recipe can be prepared with any variety of idlis like the oats idli, rava idli or nachni idli. 3. Mix gently and cook on a medium flame for 1 to 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally. Do not cook them for more time or else the idlis will start frying and turn brown. If you feel like the idli upma is turning dry then add some more water and mix it. Sometimes, people even make idli upma out of fresh idlis, as it is an interesting alternative to usual Idli and dosas. Besides Idli Upma you can use leftover idlis to make a variety of other recipes like Dahi Idli, Fried Idlis with Curd Dip , Spicy Tava Idlis, Idli Chaat, Idli Curry and Idli Chilli.

It's a comfort food enjoyed at any time of day, often served with rice or soaked-up with fluffy appams. Like idlis and dosas, sambar is also an all-time favourite that is almost synonymous with South Indian food! From the smallest roadside hotel to the classiest Indian restaurants around the globe, ‘idli, Vada, Sambar’ is a very popular breakfast combo! So, here is how to make the perfect sambhar to match the perfect Idlis / Dosas / Appe. Loaded with vegetables and dal, this flavourful side-dish is very sumptuous and tasty, leaving no doubt about why it is so popular. You can relish it not just with the innumerable South Indian snacks and Breakfast dishes, but also with a plain bowl of hot rice topped with a dollop of ghee or laced with til oil. The best part about sambar is that, while it tastes best when hot, it is quite enjoyable even after a few hours, so it can be carried to work, or prepared in advance on a busy day. Main ingredients for sambar. toovar (arhar) dal, also known as split pigeon peas or arhar dal, is the traditional and most common lentil used in making sambar. Toor dal has a mild, slightly sweet, and nutty flavor that blends well with the complex flavors of spices and other ingredients in sambar. Sambar masala is the heart and soul of sambar, a South Indian lentil stew. This aromatic spice blend forms the flavor foundation of the dish, combining coriander seeds, cumin, fenugreek, chilies, and sometimes other spices, like black peppercorns and turmeric. It adds depth and complexity, balancing earthy lentils with the sourness of tamarind and sweetness of vegetables, while its enticing aroma whets the appetite and adds a touch of vibrant color to the stew. Pro tips for sambar. 1. Add 1 cup red pumpkin (bhopla / kaddu) cubes. red pumpkin offers a gentle sweetness that complements the savory and spicy flavors of sambar. Red pumpkin readily absorbs the flavors of the spices and herbs used in sambar, contributing to the overall flavor profile. 2. Add 1/2 cup potato cubes. When cooked, potatoes contribute to the overall creaminess and richness of the sambar, especially when they are partially mashed or left to soften in the gravy. Potatoes add a mild, natural sweetness that balances the tanginess of tamarind or tomatoes often used in sambar. 3. Add 1/2 cup drumstick pieces (each cut into 2"). Drumsticks have a mild, slightly sweet flavor that complements the other spices and vegetables in sambar without overpowering them. Drumsticks are a common and well-liked vegetable in many parts of India, including South India where sambar originates. Using them in sambar reflects the regional cuisine and preferences.

Learn how to make Gujarati stuffed mixed vegetables. The highlight of this Gujarati bharelu shaak is its stuffing made with a combination of coconut, coriander and besan along with a host of spices. In this recipe we have used this stuffing to stuff only the tendli and brinjal, but if you wish you can stuff the potatoes as well. To make sambhariyu shaak, first make the stuffing. Combine grated coconut, coriander, coriander-cumin seeds powder, chilli powder, ginger-green chilli paste, sugar, turmeric powder, salt and besan and mix well. Then prepare the vegetables and temper the sabzi. Remove the ends of the tendli and the brinjals stalks. Make a vertical slit to the tendli and criss-cross slits to the brinjals. Stuff the tendli and brinjals with a little stuffing. Combine the stuffed tendli, stuffed brinjal, sweet potatoes, baby potatoes and the remaining stuffing in a deep bowl, mix well and keep aside. Heat the oil in a pressure cooker; add the asafoetida and sauté on a medium flame for a few seconds. Add the vegetable mixture and ¼ cup of water, mix well and pressure cook for 2 whistles. Allow the steam to escape before opening the lid. Serve hot. Gujarati stuffed mixed vegetables is one of the most preferred sabzi made for Sunday lunch in many households in Gujarat. While you can make stuffed aloo or stuffed bhindi solely, here’s an option with mixed vegetables which includes brinjal, baby potatoes, sweet potatoes and tendli. This dish can be customised to your liking by using any vegetables that you and your family prefer. However, the vegetables are to be selected carefully to make sure they look good and get cooked evenly. Pressure cooking is the easiest method to make this sambhariyu shaak in pressure cooker as it uses less oil, takes less time and cooks evenly. To believe it that it tastes just as the authentic shaak made on a slow flame in a kadhai, try it out! Tips for sambhariyu shaak. 1. Make sure that the slits in the tendli and brinjal only cover 50% of the vegetable length. Too deep slits might break open the vegetable while pressure cooking. 2. Make sure you add the besan in the filling to make the veggies dry. 3. Use of freshly grated coconut is highly recommended for the traditional taste. 4. Buy brinjals of small to medium size which will pair well with the rest of the veggies. 5. Make the stuffing first and then peel and prepare the vegetables as most of these vegetables turn black on exposure to air.

Samosa are a deep fried or baked Indian savoury snack with a filling, the filling is mostly potatoes, onions, lentins, green peas and now a days people have started innovating and experimenting with samosa and use noodles, pasta or even paneer as the stuffing. Samosa are a popular snack and appetizer. Samosas are from Punjab but we have our Gujarati style vegetable samosa, the recipe is a little complex yet worth it as it is extremely flavourful. We have made Gujarati style samosa covering with whole wheat flour instead of maida. Traditionally maida is used in making these Punjabi samosas. Further, the stuffing is made with first cooking the onions then adding the main ingredients like potatoes and green pease. Unlike other samosas, the Gujarati style vegetable samosa does not use boiled potatoes—here, raw potatoes are chopped and allowed to cook in oil and green peas and cooked. It would take 7-8 minutes for potatoes and green peas to cook once done we have added cabbage and ginger green chilli paste. We have also added sugar to give Gujarati samosa a twist. Further, we have added lemon juice. You can also add chat masala or amchur if you wish to. Lastly, some coriander for freshness. Thereafter, the prepared dough is used to make the patti’s for the samosa. The dough is divided equally and rolled in a thin roti then cooked on both sides not for more than 10 seconds both the side and then divided into 3 equal portions. Which would give us a patti, further the patti is folded into a cone which is stuffed with the aloo and green peas mixture sealed with maida slurry and deep fried. These gujarati style samosa are different in taste and size as compared to the traditional samosas. The size is usually smaller and these Gujarati style vegetable samosa are crispier. Samosas are my family’s favourite, we cant resist samosa at any given point of the day. You can even bake or air fry them. Have Gujarati samosa with green chutney and immediately serve them!!

While cooking the Sanwa Dosa, make sure you cook it on a medium-low flame till it is crisp. Do not remove it while soft or increase the flame to high, because that will ruin the texture of the dosa. 5. Like most dosa, this too has to be served immediately.

Notes on Schezwan fried rice recipe. 1. To cook the Chinese long-grained rice for the Schezwan Fried Rice, wash 1 cup of long-grained rice thoroughly under running water until you get clear water. The removal of starch from rice helps in getting separate grains after cooking. 2. Cook on a medium flame for 8 to 10 minutes or till the rice is 85% cooked, while stirring occasionally. It is very important to not fully cook the rice, it should be firm to bite. 3. Refresh the rice with cold water so the rice stops cooking further. Let all the water from the rice drain out ensuring that the rice does not contain any moisture. 4. Add the remaining 1 tbsp of oil. This helps in preventing the rice from sticking to each other. 5. Add the carrot and French beans. Make sure they are chopped really finely as we are not boiling or cooking them we are just sautéing them so when they are chopped finely so they not taste raw.

It is important to first shape the vada into a round and then flatten it till thin, because if it is thick, it will not cook properly and have a raw taste inside. Make sure you cook the vada on a slow flame so that it gets completely cooked inside also. Shape one vada and a time and cook it immediately on the tava. Do not shape them all at one go because they will lose their shape and also dry up before cooking. Serve these vadas immediately because they are made with less oil and tend to dry up after a while. You can also try other healthy snacks like Khumbh Ke Kebab , Healthy Momos and Triangles with Italian Relish ., preparationMethod=[Clean, wash and soak the chana dal in enough hot water for 2 hours. Drain well., Combine the soaked chana dal, dry red chillies, green chillies, cumin seeds and 2 tbsp of water in a mixer and blend to a thick coarse paste., Transfer the mixture into a deep bowl, add all the remaining ingredients and mix well using your hands., Divide the mixture into 10 equal portions and roll each portion into a 50 mm. (2”) diameter flat round vada., Heat a non-stick tava (griddle) and grease it using 1 tsp of oil.

Like many other pickles, the kundru achar also gets its flavours from a combination of rai na kuria and methi kuria along with oil and chilli powder. While not much marination is needed for this pickle, with time the tendli tends to absorb the flavours of spices and become more flavourful. Ceramic or glass jars are best suited for tendli pickle as they do not get stained easily and prevent any chemical reaction too. All health conscious can enjoy this pickle in very small quantities. Remember to include it in your diet only occasionally as it does have appreciable amounts of salt. Tips for tendli ka achar. 1. Bottle in a sterilized glass jar and store for upto 15 days. 2. Always use a clean spoon each time you use the achar. This will preserve your achar. 3. Marinating the tendli in salt is crucial.

This soft dal paste acts as a natural binding agent, helping the dough hold its shape during rolling and cooking. 2. Add 1/4 cup whole wheat flour (gehun ka atta). Whole wheat flour, with its gluten content, helps create a stronger and more elastic dough that can be rolled out thinly without tearing.

Here, we have replaced rice with lentils in order to enhance the recipe's protein content. Semolina adds crunch and makes the handvo crisper. Cut yellow moong dal handvo into pieces after cooling slightly, as it will be soft inside and you will not get proper pieces. Tempering adds the flavour to this dish, but those who are health conscious can omit it or use only 1 tsp oil for tempering. Main ingredients for yellow moong dal handvo. Put the soaked yellow moong dal in a mixer. Yellow moong dal offers a neutral and slightly nutty flavor that forms the base of the handvo. When ground into a batter, it creates a smooth and slightly grainy texture that contributes to the unique mouthfeel of handvo. Add 2 tbsp curd (dahi). Traditional handvo recipes often rely on fermentation to leaven the batter. Curds contain live bacteria cultures that ferment the sugars naturally present in the moong dal. Add 1/2 cup grated carrot. Carrots add a hint of natural sweetness to the handvo. This sweetness complements the savory flavors of the moong dal and spices, creating a more balanced and interesting taste profile. Pro tips for yellow moong dal handvo. 1. Adding rava to the batter acts as a binding agent. Moong dal itself is relatively smooth and lacks gluten, which is a natural binding agent in wheat flour. The semolina's texture, with its tiny granules, helps hold the lentil batter together, creating a more cohesive and manageable mixture. Instead of rava you can also use Oats flour as a substitute. 2. Just before cooking, add 2 tsp fruit salt. Fruit salt, also known as Eno (a brand name), is used in yellow moong dal handvo for one key reason: it acts as a leavening agent. You can also use baking soda instead of eno to make this recipe. Leavening agents help batters rise and become fluffy. 3. Gently mix the batter after adding fruit salt. Vigorous mixing can deflate the air bubbles created by the fruit salt reaction. Gentle folding incorporates the fruit salt evenly while keeping those air bubbles trapped in the batter. This leads to a lighter and fluffier final product.
