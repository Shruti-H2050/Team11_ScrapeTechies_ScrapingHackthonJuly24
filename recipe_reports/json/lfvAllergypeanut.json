    "preparationMethod": [
      "Soak the piece of foam well in water before placing it on the tray. Keep the tray at the place where you want to set up the arrangement. Slice the foam to a very low height, in keeping with the height of your low dining-table sit-down.",
      "Depending on their thickness, make four equal-looking bundles of the asparagus, probably using 8 to 10 stems in each. Tie each bundle up with lemongrass and place the bundles along the base of the tray, forming a square. Then tie the four corners with lemongrass to hold the asparagus in place.",
      "Before using the roses, cut the stems to about 6\" to 8\" and leave them in water for about 1/2 hour so that they last longer. Here we have chosen pink and white roses.",
      "Place the roses first in the outer square of the sponge, alternating the white with the pink. Then, in a similar manner, fill up the whole square.",
      "To finish off, use the asparagus ferns to cover up any spaces where the foam is still visible.",
      "If you find asparagus difficult to find, use small drumsticks instead."

The fruit’s high water and fibre content also help by adding bulk to the faeces and enabling it to pass the digestive tract faster.

Try this unusual combination of fruits and vegetables for some real health power with a vitamin C and calcium boost in a glass. There are many types of lettuce available. Dark green varieties lend a slightly bitter taste to juices, so use only the lighter green variety of lettuce. It is easier to juice firm leaves rather than softer leaves. A glass of Lemony Lettuce Drink with a healthy snack like Mini Jowar and Tomato Uttapa , Oats Moong Toast or Chola Dal Dhokla is a great way to start the day off on the right foot.",

Here is a healthier and tastier version that you can make at home. The muskmelon, pineapple and wheatgrass juice pools in the nutrition of fruits with that of wheatgrass, resulting in a fibre-rich, pleasantly-coloured, delicious juice that is ideal for breakfast, especially for those wanting to lose weight. Apart from adding ‘zero fat’ bulk to the juice, muskmelon is also high in fibre and vitamin A. So, it helps you keep full without adding calories. Pineapple imparts a natural sweetness to the juice and can be considered as a good substitute to high-calorie sweets and dessert. Besides, an enzyme present in pineapple called bromelain aids in digestion. Wheatgrass contains chlorophyll, which helps purify the liver and also neutralizes toxins. It also helps in lowering blood cholesterol by blocking its absorption.",

    "recipeDescription": "Orange is a please-all flavour, loved by almost everybody. Here is an exciting slush made in this popular flavour, perked up with a dash of spice powders that give it a chatpata touch. Crushed ice is essential to get the characteristic mouth-feel of a slush. We suggest crushing the ice using an ice-crusher or gola maker as crushing it in a mixer or by hand might make it chunky or watery without getting a uniform texture. To relish the refreshing flavour and exciting mouth-feel of the Orange Slush, serve it immediately after preparation. You can also have a go at other fabulous sorbets like the Plum and Banana Sorbet or Strawberry Banana Apple Sorbet .",
    "preparationMethod": [

The orange yellow combination is not only pretty to look at, but will also add powerful antioxidants that will detoxify your system. Fruit Infuser Water Bottles are easily available all over India, in online shops as well as the home needs section of supermarkets and retail chains. If you don’t have a Fruit Infuser Bottle, you can just use any glass jar or pitcher. Put the fruits and vegetables in the pitcher along with water and allow them to infuse for 2 to 3 hours. Then, strain the mixture to get detox water. The fruits and vegetables can be discarded or more water can be added to make more detox water. Do not use the fruits or vegetables for more than twice. You can also try other Fruit Infused Water recipes from our collection like the Lemony Papaya Infused Water or Honey Banana Infused Water .",
