I love eating tuvar dal khichdi with papad, pickle and curd. To make a complete and grand meal you can serve the arhar dal khichdi with Rasawala Bateta Nu Shaak, any form of Kadhi and Rotla. I would like to share some important tips to make the perfect toor dal with rice khichdi. 1. We have used regular surti kolam rice, if you want, you can also use Basmati rice variety. 2. soak toor dal and rice for at least 30 minutes. Soaking will help in cooking the toovar dal ni khichdi fast. 3. Add 3½ cups of hot water. Hot water fastens the cooking process. This khichdi won’t have a mushy consistency. If you want the consistency slightly soft, add more water. 4. Pressure cook for 4 whistles. Allow the steam to escape before opening the lid or else you might burn yourself with the hot steam. Once the pressure cooker depressurizes and cools completely, then only open the lid as the toovar dal ni khichdi is still cooking inside and the grains might remain raw if you are impatient and open it before time. The Gujarati toor dal khichdi is wholesome and takes hardly any time to cook. All you would require is a glass of cold chaas to gulp it down. If you enjoyed toor dal khichdi | toovar dal ni khichdi | Gujarati toor dal khichdi | toor dal with rice khichdi | arhar dal khichdi with detailed step by step photos, also try making other Gujarati khichdi recipes like Fada ni Khichdi, Makai ni Khichdi,Handi Khichdi.",

You can actually smell the ghee from outside the house, and it will make you drool! Since the batter for this dosa uses more urad than usual dosas, the Tuppa Dosa also turns out soft and fluffy, which makes it doubly delightful. The reddish brown hue, and rich aroma of ghee and fenugreek make this dosa a truly special culinary treat! Enjoy it hot off the tava with sambhar and chutney. Try other dosa recipes like Set Dosa and Neer Dosa .",
