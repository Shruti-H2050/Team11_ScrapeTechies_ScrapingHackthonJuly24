While sliced french beans can be used alone and tossed in with dressing, we’ve used green cucumber and celery to add extra bite and crunch into the salad. Toasted sesame seeds too enhance the taste. We’ve used the tangy vinaigrette dressing in the salad, but you could experiment with other dressing too. Serve this salad immediately!",

A lusciously smooth and tasty sauce of mango pulp and curds adds to the allure of assorted fruits like apple, pear and kiwi in this fruity dessert.

Serve the Mixed Fruits Topped with Mango Sauce immediately upon preparation as the curds might let out water if left for too long.",

Here is a healthier and tastier version that you can make at home. The muskmelon, pineapple and wheatgrass juice pools in the nutrition of fruits with that of wheatgrass, resulting in a fibre-rich, pleasantly-coloured, delicious juice that is ideal for breakfast, especially for those wanting to lose weight. Apart from adding ‘zero fat’ bulk to the juice, muskmelon is also high in fibre and vitamin A. So, it helps you keep full without adding calories. Pineapple imparts a natural sweetness to the juice and can be considered as a good substitute to high-calorie sweets and dessert. Besides, an enzyme present in pineapple called bromelain aids in digestion. Wheatgrass contains chlorophyll, which helps purify the liver and also neutralizes toxins. It also helps in lowering blood cholesterol by blocking its absorption.",

Here is an exciting slush made in this popular flavour, perked up with a dash of spice powders that give it a chatpata touch. Crushed ice is essential to get the characteristic mouth-feel of a slush. We suggest crushing the ice using an ice-crusher or gola maker as crushing it in a mixer or by hand might make it chunky or watery without getting a uniform texture. To relish the refreshing flavour and exciting mouth-feel of the Orange Slush, serve it immediately after preparation. You can also have a go at other fabulous sorbets like the Plum and Banana Sorbet or Strawberry Banana Apple Sorbet .",

You will love this tasty drink as it innovative and extremely healthy too, with the goodness of fresh aloe vera. While the pineapple, papaya and aloe vera juice is a good addition to anybody’s breakfast , it is highly recommended for those with hypertension. Aloe vera helps manage blood pressure as it dilates capillaries and enhances circulation, thus ensuring a proper flow of blood. It is also rich in vitamin c, which according to scientific research helps lower blood pressure. Besides, aloe vera also works wonders for the skin! a diet that includes natural sources of potassium, such as pineapples, lessens the effect of sodium and thus lowers blood pressure. Coming to papaya, this wonderful fruit not only adds bulk to the juice but also contains a compound called papain, which helps to regulate blood pressure .",
