    "recipeDescription": "Papaya is a lovely fruit that’s loved by young and old alike. The best part is that it is not too expensive and it commonly available everywhere. This delicious fruit is also very beneficial for your health. It contains a digestive enzyme called papain, which helps to relieve constipation. The fruit’s high water and fibre content also help by adding bulk to the faeces and enabling it to pass the digestive tract faster. The greener the papaya, the higher the papain content in it, so go for partially ripe papayas if you want to relieve constipation. Although the whole fruit is best, you can also enjoy it as papaya juice, provided you make it in a juicer and do not strain it. You need to have at least 1 – 1 1/2 cups of juice or more to get relief from constipation.",

    "recipeDescription": "Down South, especially in cities like Chennai, it is very common to see people stopping at juice stalls during their morning walk, to take a glass of wheatgrass juice with a dash of lemon. Here is a healthier and tastier version that you can make at home. The muskmelon, pineapple and wheatgrass juice pools in the nutrition of fruits with that of wheatgrass, resulting in a fibre-rich, pleasantly-coloured, delicious juice that is ideal for breakfast, especially for those wanting to lose weight. Apart from adding ‘zero fat’ bulk to the juice, muskmelon is also high in fibre and vitamin A. So, it helps you keep full without adding calories. Pineapple imparts a natural sweetness to the juice and can be considered as a good substitute to high-calorie sweets and dessert. Besides, an enzyme present in pineapple called bromelain aids in digestion. Wheatgrass contains chlorophyll, which helps purify the liver and also neutralizes toxins. It also helps in lowering blood cholesterol by blocking its absorption.",
    "preparationMethod": [
      "Add muskmelon cubes, pineapple cubes, wheat grass and orange segments and blend in a juicer till smooth.",
      "Add some crushed ice in 2 individual glasses and pour equal quantities of the juice over it.",
      "Serve immediately.",
      "This recipe doesn’t turn out good in a hopper because wheat grass does not grind well in a hopper."

To relish the refreshing flavour and exciting mouth-feel of the Orange Slush, serve it immediately after preparation. You can also have a go at other fabulous sorbets like the Plum and Banana Sorbet or Strawberry Banana Apple Sorbet .",
