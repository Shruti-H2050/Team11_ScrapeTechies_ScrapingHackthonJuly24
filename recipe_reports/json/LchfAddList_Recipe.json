Drain on an absorbent paper. Serve immediately with green chutney and tomato ketchup. Pakodas don’t always have to be onion-based. Here is an irresistibly crunchy and excitingly flavoured cabbage pakora South Indian style made with patta gobhi. With a flavourful touch of coriander, the cabbage is held together with besan to make awesome pakodas. The Indian patta gobhi ke pakode pairs best with green chutney or tomato ketchup.

Cabbage should be shredded thinly as shown here. 2. Remember to not add too much water while mixing the ingredients because cabbage will also slowly let out water as you have shredded it thinly. That, along with a tablespoon or two of water, is enough to bind the batter. If the batter becomes watery, the pakodas won’t be crunchy enough. 3. This mixture should be used immediately and not kept for long as it will release water and you will find it difficult to make pakodas. 4. Oil should be hot and always deep-fry on a medium flame so they cook well. Do not fry them over low flame, the cabbage pakoda will absorb too much oil and turn soggy. And if you deep-fry on a high flame then they will get burnt.

Paneer is widely used and very popular in Punjab due to the abundance of milk and milk products in the area. To make homemade palak paneer you need to make a spinach puree first. Then heat the oil in a kadhai , add the onions and sauté on a medium flame till they turn translucent. Add the garlic, ginger, green chillies and turmeric powder and sauté on a medium flame for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the tomato pulp and sauté till the mixture leaves oil, while stirring continuously. Add the spinach purée and 2 tbsp of water, mix well and cook on a medium flame for 2 minutes. Add the salt, garam masala and fresh cream and mix well. Add the paneer, mix gently and cook on a medium flame for another 1 to 2 minutes. Serve spinach with cottage cheese hot. Some tips to make the perfect palak paneer recipe. 1. Blanch the spinach for 2 to 3 minutes. If you boil the spinach for long, the spinach will lose its colour and the Palak Paneer gravy will come out dark. 2. Run the strainer below cold water to refresh the spinach. This stops the cooking process of the spinach. It is a very important step in the Palak Paneer Recipe as you do not want to overcook the spinach. 3. We do not add the garam masala in the beginning because adding it earlier would make it bitter. This combination of spinach and paneer is not only highly nutritious, but is a splendid blend of taste, texture and flavour. The paneer in this homemade palak paneer recipe has been fried to add some extra flavour. You can however add the paneer pieces without frying if required.

Gnocchi are boiled in the same fashion as pasta is and are served generally with a cream based sauce. Spinach and cottage cheese gnocchi served in a toasted almond and butter sauce makes an outstanding first course. Alternatively, try gnocchi as a rich and creamy side dish. Make sure you drain out all the water from the spinach before you make the gnocchi. Test one gnocchi by boiling it in water. If it crumbles, add some more flour to the mixture. Always make the gnocchi the day you are going to serve them, because they will discolour if left overnight. Also prepare the sauce just before you are ready to eat!",

It has a crisper texture than our regular greens, and so it combines wonderfully with spinach and bean sprouts in this delicious Stir-Fried Chinese Greens recipe. While Chinese white sauce gives it a creamy consistency, soy sauce lends a tangy tinge, giving the dish a very well-balanced and exciting flavour. As in most greens based dishes, it is best to serve this immediately to enjoy the best texture and vibrant colour of the greens.",
