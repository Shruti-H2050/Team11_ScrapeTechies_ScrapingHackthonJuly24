Learn how to make cabbage pakora South Indian style. To make cabbage pakoda, combine all the ingredients along with approx. 2 tbsp of water in a deep bowl and mix well. Drop spoonfuls of the mixture into hot oil in a deep non-stick pan and deep-fry a few at a time on a medium flame, till they turn golden brown in colour from all the sides. Drain on an absorbent paper. Serve immediately with green chutney and tomato ketchup. Pakodas don’t always have to be onion-based. Here is an irresistibly crunchy and excitingly flavoured cabbage pakora South Indian style made with patta gobhi. With a flavourful touch of coriander, the cabbage is held together with besan to make awesome pakodas. The Indian patta gobhi ke pakode pairs best with green chutney or tomato ketchup. You can also serve them hot and fresh for parties or as a quick snack, with a cup of steaming tea or coffee. If you like Indian patta gobhi ke pakode, then also try other pakoras like Khichdi Pakodas, Stuffed Methi Paneer Pakoda, Stuffed Spinach Pakoda to make a pakoda platter. Tips for cabbage pakoda. 1. Cabbage should be shredded thinly as shown here. 2. Remember to not add too much water while mixing the ingredients because cabbage will also slowly let out water as you have shredded it thinly. That, along with a tablespoon or two of water, is enough to bind the batter. If the batter becomes watery, the pakodas won’t be crunchy enough. 3. This mixture should be used immediately and not kept for long as it will release water and you will find it difficult to make pakodas. 4. Oil should be hot and always deep-fry on a medium flame so they cook well. Do not fry them over low flame, the cabbage pakoda will absorb too much oil and turn soggy. And if you deep-fry on a high flame then they will get burnt.

During baking, the pizza dough swells somewhat until it resembles a \"stuffed stocking\", the literal translation of word calzone. Sautéed vegetables and cheese aromatized with herbs is the filling for this calzone. You can vary the vegetable combination if you like. For a change, try frying the calzone until golden brown in hot oil. You will find that it is easier to handle the calzone during frying when it has been formed into appetiser sized calzonetti (or smaller calzones). Calzone can stand alone as a substantial snack or combined with a green salad and soup, it makes an easy dinner.",

This homemade coconut butter has a naturally sweet taste, which makes it a wonderful accompaniment for nutritious breads and other snacks. It takes around 10 minutes to blend this, so make sure you give breaks in between. If you grind continuously, your mixer will heat up and stop working. Once done, this butter stays fresh for 15 to 20 days at room temperature, and for a month in the refrigerator. You can also try other recipes like Coconut Flour Bread or Almond Bread .",

Made of garlic and flaxseeds, this chutney has a spicy taste that gives your taste buds an effective shake! Crushing garlic cloves activates an enzyme called Allinase, which helps convert Alliin to Allicin. This Allicin has appreciable health benefits, including anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties. But we agree that peeling and crushing garlic can be quite a task! We suggest you soak the garlic cloves in hot water for a while, as it makes them easier to peel. Also, oil your hands to avoid the garlicky aroma lingering on your fingertips. This peppy Garlic-Flaxseed Chutney stays good for around 10-12 days, so you can make a batch and keep it handy to enjoy as and when required.",

Paneer is widely used and very popular in Punjab due to the abundance of milk and milk products in the area. To make homemade palak paneer you need to make a spinach puree first. Then heat the oil in a kadhai , add the onions and sauté on a medium flame till they turn translucent.

Add the paneer, mix gently and cook on a medium flame for another 1 to 2 minutes. Serve spinach with cottage cheese hot. Some tips to make the perfect palak paneer recipe. 1. Blanch the spinach for 2 to 3 minutes. If you boil the spinach for long, the spinach will lose its colour and the Palak Paneer gravy will come out dark. 2. Run the strainer below cold water to refresh the spinach. This stops the cooking process of the spinach. It is a very important step in the Palak Paneer Recipe as you do not want to overcook the spinach. 3. We do not add the garam masala in the beginning because adding it earlier would make it bitter. This combination of spinach and paneer is not only highly nutritious, but is a splendid blend of taste, texture and flavour. The paneer in this homemade palak paneer recipe has been fried to add some extra flavour. You can however add the paneer pieces without frying if required.

Gnocchi are boiled in the same fashion as pasta is and are served generally with a cream based sauce. Spinach and cottage cheese gnocchi served in a toasted almond and butter sauce makes an outstanding first course. Alternatively, try gnocchi as a rich and creamy side dish. Make sure you drain out all the water from the spinach before you make the gnocchi. Test one gnocchi by boiling it in water. If it crumbles, add some more flour to the mixture. Always make the gnocchi the day you are going to serve them, because they will discolour if left overnight. Also prepare the sauce just before you are ready to eat!",
