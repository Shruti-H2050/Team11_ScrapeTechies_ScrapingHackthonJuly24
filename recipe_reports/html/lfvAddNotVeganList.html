I love eating tuvar dal khichdi with papad, pickle and curd. To make a complete and grand meal you can serve the arhar dal khichdi with Rasawala Bateta Nu Shaak, any form of Kadhi and Rotla. I would like to share some important tips to make the perfect toor dal with rice khichdi. 1. We have used regular surti kolam rice, if you want, you can also use Basmati rice variety. 2. soak toor dal and rice for at least 30 minutes. Soaking will help in cooking the toovar dal ni khichdi fast. 3. Add 3½ cups of hot water. Hot water fastens the cooking process. This khichdi won’t have a mushy consistency. If you want the consistency slightly soft, add more water. 4. Pressure cook for 4 whistles. Allow the steam to escape before opening the lid or else you might burn yourself with the hot steam. Once the pressure cooker depressurizes and cools completely, then only open the lid as the toovar dal ni khichdi is still cooking inside and the grains might remain raw if you are impatient and open it before time. The Gujarati toor dal khichdi is wholesome and takes hardly any time to cook. All you would require is a glass of cold chaas to gulp it down.
