An anjeer smoothie is a delicious and nutritious Indian beverage made from blending dried figs (anjeer) with ingredients such as yogurt, bananas, vanilla extract, honey (optional) , and ice. The sweet and slightly nutty flavor of the figs adds a unique twist to the anjeer smoothie, making it a refreshing and satisfying drink. anjeer smoothie is not only tasty but also packed with fiber, vitamins, and minerals, making it a healthy choice for a snack or breakfast option.

Cheers to a refreshing and satisfying beverage that is as good for you as it is delicious! Options to add for anjeer smoothie For kids you can add 3/4 cup coarsely crushed sweet biscuits (Parle-G). 1 cup vanilla ice-cream to get a richer taste. You can use 1 cup chilled milk instead of 1 cup low fat curds (dahi) or curd (dahi). Key ingredients of anjeer smoothie. 1. Soaked dried figs (anjeer). Dried figs are a concentrated source of natural sugars, offering sweetness to the smoothie without needing refined sugar or artificial sweeteners. This makes them a healthy alternative for those seeking a naturally sweet drink. Anjeer has a distinct flavor profile that combines sweetness with a subtle earthy and nutty taste. 2. Bananas are naturally sweet and have a creamy texture, making them a perfect base for smoothies. They add sweetness to balance the slightly tart or earthy flavor of dried figs without needing refined sugar. Additionally, the bananas help create a thick and creamy consistency, improving the mouthfeel of the smoothie. Pro tips for anjeer smoothie. 1. Add 1 cup low fat curds (dahi). Curd adds a creamy texture and thickness to the smoothie, making it more satisfying and enjoyable to drink. This is particularly beneficial for anjeer smoothies, as dried figs can have a slightly chewy texture. Curd introduces a subtle tangy flavor to the smoothie, which helps to balance the sweetness of the dried figs and other added ingredients like honey. 2. Add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Vanilla extract adds a subtle sweetness and a touch of complex vanilla aroma that complements the fig flavor without overpowering it. Vanilla extract is a potent flavoring, so a small amount (usually 1/2 teaspoon or less) is typically used in anjeer smoothies. Too much vanilla extract can overpower the delicate flavor of the figs.

Add some crushed ice in 2 individual glasses and pour equal quantities of the juice over it. Serve apple lemon cooler immediately. “An apple a day keeps the doctor away”, says the proverb and it\u0027s almost true. Apples are a storehouse of fibre which helps to keep your digestive tract healthy. Apples contain an enzyme called \u0027polyphenolase\u0027, which when comes in contact with oxygen produces coloured phenolic compounds that impart undesirable brown colour to the pieces. However, some amount of fibre is lost in the process of juicing. Hence we recommend that you use a high quality blender and not strain the juice, to benefit the most from apple lemon cooler. A dash of lime cuts through the sweetness perfectly and zips up the flavour of this apple and lemon juice. It also adds enough vitamin C.

To prevent the apple from browning, cut the apples just before juicing or simply squeeze lemon juice over the pieces. 2. Use unpeeled apples preferably, as much of the fibre lies beneath the skin of the fruits. 3. Serve it immediately to benefit from the vitamin C from lemon juice. This is because vitamin C is a volatile nutrient and some of it is lost on exposure to air. 4. We do not recommend this juice for diabetics as it can be a dose of excess carbs at a time.

This dal kabila should be eaten hot as it tends to become thick and mushy when cold. Also avoid going overboard with the cream as this too will lead to the texture of the tadka urad dal turning sticky. Notes on dal kabila recipe. 1. Take a deep nonstick pan and heat some ghee in it. You can even use butter if you do not have ghee but as this is a Mughlai recipe, ghee will give a richer and better taste. 2. We also add turmeric powder, coriander powder and salt along with the other spices. While the turmeric powder gives the dal kabila its unique yellow color, it is the coriander powder that imparts flavor. 3. Switch off the flame, add the fresh cream. Fresh cream is only added after turning off the flame because if it is heated continuously, there is a chance it might curdle. This dal can be served with rice as well as with rotis or parathas.

To make these garlic rotis, simply mix jowar flour, bajra flour, minced garlic, salt, green chilli paste, sesame seeds and water to form a smooth dough. Divide the dough into small portions, roll them out into thin circles, and cook them with ghee on a hot griddle until they are cooked through and slightly crispy. These gluten-free garlic rotis are perfect for those who are looking to avoid gluten in their diet but still want to enjoy delicious and satisfying Indian bread. They pair well with a variety of curries, dals, and chutneys, making them a versatile and tasty addition to any meal. Garlic, green chilli paste and sesame seeds add a distinctive flavour to these otherwise bland rotis. For best results, serve these easy-to-make garlic rotis with a smattering of ghee. Pro tips for garlic roti. 1. In a big bowl put 1/2 cup bajra (black millet) flour. As the name suggests, bajra flour, also known as pearl millet flour, is naturally gluten-free. This makes it a perfect substitute for wheat flour in recipes like gluten-free garlic roti, catering to people with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those who simply prefer a gluten-free diet. 2. Add 1 tsp garlic (lehsun) paste. Garlic is a well-known flavor booster. Its pungent and savory taste adds a significant layer of complexity to the roti, which might otherwise be bland due to the limitations of gluten-free flours. Garlic paste infuses the roti with a delicious garlicky character that makes it more enjoyable. Enjoy garlic roti recipe | healthy lehsuni roti | gluten free garlic roti | with step by step photos.",

We have a very easy recipe using jowar that is Jowar roti also known as \"Sorghum roti\" We have made this healhy jowar roti with jowar flour and little salt to taste. The only trick is kneading of the dough. All you need to do is take required water in a deep non stick pan get it to boil and add jowar flour to it. Mix well and let it cool. Once it has cooled down a little, knead into a soft dough. Make sure the dough has cooled down or you may burn your hands.

Remove it in a plate and smear with ghee. Jowar roti is super rich in fibre, is gluten free, good for diabetics, heart, weight loss, high in magnesium, iron and also lowers blood pressure and cholesterol. We have used hot water for kneading the dough as it helps in getting the roti soft and even when not served for hours, it doesn\u0027t become hard or chewy. But you also need to make sure that you roll out the roti immediately after kneading the dough as if you would keep the dough for a long time, it will loose its moisture and would become splintery which would make rolling difficult. My grandmother would cook it on an earthen clay oven on a chulha which would give a smoky flavor to the roti. Whenever we cook jowar roti at home, i make any Maharashtrian sabzi to eat along.

Although it makes use of minimal ingredients, the Khatta Urad Dal has a distinct, tongue-tickling flavour that you are sure to relish. The highlight of this recipe, as the name suggests, is its sourness, so make sure the curds are sour enough.

Add loads of fresh, finely-chopped coriander as it imparts a wonderfully peppy tinge to this sumptuous and protein boosting dal.",

Usually, when deep-fried papads are used to prepare Masala Papad, the oil helps to hold the chopped vegetables and spice powders in place. Here, we have used a layer of peppy green chutney for the purpose. Not only does this bind the toppings with the papad, it also enhances the flavour manifold. Enjoy this spicy treat occasionally, because moderation is always essential. And always remember to serve this snack immediately on preparation, especially because green chutney is added and the papad will become soggy after a while.",

Fresh green peppercorns with their stalks can be added if they are in season. This pickle stays well for 8 to 10 days. It will get sour as time passes, you may need to add some sugar as that happens.

    "recipeDescription": "Down South, especially in cities like Chennai, it is very common to see people stopping at juice stalls during their morning walk, to take a glass of wheatgrass juice with a dash of lemon. Here is a healthier and tastier version that you can make at home. The muskmelon, pineapple and wheatgrass juice pools in the nutrition of fruits with that of wheatgrass, resulting in a fibre-rich, pleasantly-coloured, delicious juice that is ideal for breakfast, especially for those wanting to lose weight. Apart from adding ‘zero fat’ bulk to the juice, muskmelon is also high in fibre and vitamin A. So, it helps you keep full without adding calories. Pineapple imparts a natural sweetness to the juice and can be considered as a good substitute to high-calorie sweets and dessert. Besides, an enzyme present in pineapple called bromelain aids in digestion. Wheatgrass contains chlorophyll, which helps purify the liver and also neutralizes toxins. It also helps in lowering blood cholesterol by blocking its absorption.",
    "preparationMethod": [
      "Add muskmelon cubes, pineapple cubes, wheat grass and orange segments and blend in a juicer till smooth.",
      "Add some crushed ice in 2 individual glasses and pour equal quantities of the juice over it.",
      "Serve immediately.",
      "This recipe doesn’t turn out good in a hopper because wheat grass does not grind well in a hopper."

Made of steamed rice flour and grated coconut, Puttu has a unique taste and texture, which comes from the special container that it is steamed in. Traditionally, Puttu was steamed in coconut shells but now stainless steel puttu steamers are readily available in shops. Puttu can be made in a cup shape or cylindrical shape depending on the container used to steam it. You just need to make sure that you do not press the flour-mix tightly in the container, but just fill it loosely. If you pack it tightly, there will be no space for air to expand inside the flour and you will end up with hard Puttu. Serve the Puttu immediately after preparation, with a sweet or savoury side-dish. It tastes great with just jaggery and bananas, or can be served with Kadala Curry .",
