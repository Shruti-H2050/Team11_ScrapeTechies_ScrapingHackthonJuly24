      "Depending on their thickness, make four equal-looking bundles of the asparagus, probably using 8 to 10 stems in each. Tie each bundle up with lemongrass and place the bundles along the base of the tray, forming a square. Then tie the four corners with lemongrass to hold the asparagus in place.",
      "Before using the roses, cut the stems to about 6\" to 8\" and leave them in water for about 1/2 hour so that they last longer. Here we have chosen pink and white roses.",
      "Place the roses first in the outer square of the sponge, alternating the white with the pink. Then, in a similar manner, fill up the whole square.",
      "To finish off, use the asparagus ferns to cover up any spaces where the foam is still visible.",
      "If you find asparagus difficult to find, use small drumsticks instead."

Indian black grape juice, also known as kale angoor ka ras or karehal ka juice, offers a distinctive taste and experience different from typical grape juices. Here\u0027s a description: A beautiful deep purple color due to the anthocyanin pigments in black grapes. While green grapes abound in vitamin C as a source of antioxidants, the black variety also is rich in ‘anthocyanins’ that give them their colour. Both these antioxidants are present in highest amounts just beneath the skin. Thus it is advisable to wash the grapes thoroughly and enjoy them. A rich and intense aroma with notes of ripe black grapes, sometimes carrying hints of earthiness or spice depending on the variety and regional variations. To make angoor ka sharbat, in a mixer put the grapes. Add cumin seeds powder, lemon juice and grated ginger, 1/2 cups water and 24 ice cubes. Blend into a smooth and creamy mixture. Pour into 4 individual glasses. Serve angoor ka sharbat chilled garnished with mint leaves. Main ingredients for Mughlai black grape drink 1. black grapes or grapes. grapes provide the dominant sweetness. The flavonoid quercetin found in grapes helps to reduce the risk of heart diseases and prevents the onset of stroke. Resveratrol is another antioxidant that grapes possess. 2. lemon juice. Grapes are naturally sweet, and even grape juice can be quite sugary. A touch of lemon juice adds a touch of acidity, which can help cut through the sweetness and create a more balanced flavor profile. This is particularly useful when using sweeter grape varieties for the juice. Lemon juice can introduce additional citrusy notes that complement the flavors of the grapes and add complexity to the juice. Lemon is a very good source of vitamin C and thus helps in the production of white blood cells and antibodies in the blood which attacks invading microorganisms, prevents infection and builds immunity. With not too high a sodium count to its credit coupled with good levels of potassium (5.7% per cup), grapes in kale angoor ka ras contain the necessary minerals to maintain high blood pressure. Low intakes of potassiumhave often been linked to poor control of blood pressure and strokes. Pro tips for kale angoor ka ras. 1. Add 1/2 tsp grated ginger (adrak). Grated ginger is often added to grape juice to enhance its flavor and provide additional health benefits. The spicy, pungent, and slightly sweet flavor of ginger complements the natural sweetness of grape juice, creating a delicious and complex flavor profile. Ginger is an effective cure for congestion, sore throat, cold and cough. 2. Add 3/4th tsp cumin seeds (jeera) powder. Cumin powder has a warm, earthy, and slightly citrusy aroma and flavor profile. While its use in this context might be unconventional, it could potentially complement the sweetness and tartness of the grapes and add a unique savory depth to the juice. The most common benefit of jeera known to many is to soothe the stomach, intestine and the entire digestive tract. Cumin seeds are apparently a very good source of iron.

You can use 1 cup chilled milk instead of 1 cup low fat curds (dahi) or curd (dahi). Key ingredients of anjeer smoothie. 1. Soaked dried figs (anjeer). Dried figs are a concentrated source of natural sugars, offering sweetness to the smoothie without needing refined sugar or artificial sweeteners. This makes them a healthy alternative for those seeking a naturally sweet drink. Anjeer has a distinct flavor profile that combines sweetness with a subtle earthy and nutty taste. 2. Bananas are naturally sweet and have a creamy texture, making them a perfect base for smoothies. They add sweetness to balance the slightly tart or earthy flavor of dried figs without needing refined sugar. Additionally, the bananas help create a thick and creamy consistency, improving the mouthfeel of the smoothie. Pro tips for anjeer smoothie. 1. Add 1 cup low fat curds (dahi). Curd adds a creamy texture and thickness to the smoothie, making it more satisfying and enjoyable to drink. This is particularly beneficial for anjeer smoothies, as dried figs can have a slightly chewy texture. Curd introduces a subtle tangy flavor to the smoothie, which helps to balance the sweetness of the dried figs and other added ingredients like honey. 2. Add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Vanilla extract adds a subtle sweetness and a touch of complex vanilla aroma that complements the fig flavor without overpowering it. Vanilla extract is a potent flavoring, so a small amount (usually 1/2 teaspoon or less) is typically used in anjeer smoothies. Too much vanilla extract can overpower the delicate flavor of the figs.

Add some crushed ice in 2 individual glasses and pour equal quantities of the juice over it. Serve apple lemon cooler immediately. “An apple a day keeps the doctor away”, says the proverb and it\u0027s almost true. Apples are a storehouse of fibre which helps to keep your digestive tract healthy. Apples contain an enzyme called \u0027polyphenolase\u0027, which when comes in contact with oxygen produces coloured phenolic compounds that impart undesirable brown colour to the pieces. However, some amount of fibre is lost in the process of juicing. Hence we recommend that you use a high quality blender and not strain the juice, to benefit the most from apple lemon cooler. A dash of lime cuts through the sweetness perfectly and zips up the flavour of this apple and lemon juice. It also adds enough vitamin C.

To prevent the apple from browning, cut the apples just before juicing or simply squeeze lemon juice over the pieces. 2. Use unpeeled apples preferably, as much of the fibre lies beneath the skin of the fruits. 3. Serve it immediately to benefit from the vitamin C from lemon juice. This is because vitamin C is a volatile nutrient and some of it is lost on exposure to air. 4. We do not recommend this juice for diabetics as it can be a dose of excess carbs at a time.

This dal kabila should be eaten hot as it tends to become thick and mushy when cold. Also avoid going overboard with the cream as this too will lead to the texture of the tadka urad dal turning sticky. Notes on dal kabila recipe. 1. Take a deep nonstick pan and heat some ghee in it. You can even use butter if you do not have ghee but as this is a Mughlai recipe, ghee will give a richer and better taste. 2. We also add turmeric powder, coriander powder and salt along with the other spices. While the turmeric powder gives the dal kabila its unique yellow color, it is the coriander powder that imparts flavor. 3. Switch off the flame, add the fresh cream. Fresh cream is only added after turning off the flame because if it is heated continuously, there is a chance it might curdle. This dal can be served with rice as well as with rotis or parathas.

I am excited to share with you a delicious and healthy garlic roti recipe, it’s a gluten-free roti made with garlic, jowar flour and bajra flour. These rotis are not only nutritious but also incredibly flavorful, thanks to the addition of garlic. To make these garlic rotis, simply mix jowar flour, bajra flour, minced garlic, salt, green chilli paste, sesame seeds and water to form a smooth dough. Divide the dough into small portions, roll them out into thin circles, and cook them with ghee on a hot griddle until they are cooked through and slightly crispy. These gluten-free garlic rotis are perfect for those who are looking to avoid gluten in their diet but still want to enjoy delicious and satisfying Indian bread. They pair well with a variety of curries, dals, and chutneys, making them a versatile and tasty addition to any meal. Garlic, green chilli paste and sesame seeds add a distinctive flavour to these otherwise bland rotis. For best results, serve these easy-to-make garlic rotis with a smattering of ghee. Pro tips for garlic roti. 1. In a big bowl put 1/2 cup bajra (black millet) flour. As the name suggests, bajra flour, also known as pearl millet flour, is naturally gluten-free. This makes it a perfect substitute for wheat flour in recipes like gluten-free garlic roti, catering to people with celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, or those who simply prefer a gluten-free diet. 2. Add 1 tsp garlic (lehsun) paste. Garlic is a well-known flavor booster. Its pungent and savory taste adds a significant layer of complexity to the roti, which might otherwise be bland due to the limitations of gluten-free flours. Garlic paste infuses the roti with a delicious garlicky character that makes it more enjoyable. Enjoy garlic roti recipe | healthy lehsuni roti | gluten free garlic roti | with step by step photos.",

Made of garlic and flaxseeds, this chutney has a spicy taste that gives your taste buds an effective shake! Crushing garlic cloves activates an enzyme called Allinase, which helps convert Alliin to Allicin. This Allicin has appreciable health benefits, including anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties. But we agree that peeling and crushing garlic can be quite a task! We suggest you soak the garlic cloves in hot water for a while, as it makes them easier to peel. Also, oil your hands to avoid the garlicky aroma lingering on your fingertips. This peppy Garlic-Flaxseed Chutney stays good for around 10-12 days, so you can make a batch and keep it handy to enjoy as and when required.",

The procedure is quite simple – you just need to blend the ingredients together and serve it chilled. One thing you need to ensure when making the Ginger Ale Drink with Vanilla Ice-Cream is that the ginger ale must be chilled before preparation, because you have to serve it immediately after blending. If you refrigerate the drink after blending, it will lose its fizz. You can also try other interesting drinks like the Khus Lime Cup and Orange Soda with Vanilla Ice-Cream .",

Green chutney is a flavorful condiment made with mint leaves, coriander leaves, lemon juice for tanginess and green chillies for some spice and ginger. All the ingredients are blend together and the chutney is made. Hara chutney is amazing and elevates the taste and flavour of Indian snacks. Make the Indian green chutney in advance and store it in the refrigerator. It can be stored for minimum of 15 days. I would like to share some important tips to make the perfect Indian green chutney. 1. Add the lemon juice to the hara chutney as this will help maintain the colour. If you don’t add lemon juice, the green chutney will keep on getting darker. 2. Add roughly chopped green chillies to the blender for spice. You can increase or reduce the chillies according to your preference. 3. Blend coriander and mint chutney into a smooth paste. You will have to stir it once or twice in between to get a smooth paste. It is a perfect pair to Popular Indian Snacks. My favourite snacks which are had as with green chutney are Grilled Sandwich, Sev Puri, Khatta Dhokla, Cauliflower and Oats Tikki and Bajra, Carrot and Onion Uttapa. The green chutney is a simple and easy recipe that has no unhealthy or calorie-laden ingredients like sugar. This hari chutney also provides antioxidants like vitamin A and Vitamin C. These substances which help reduce inflammation in the body and ward off free radicals which otherwise can lead to chronic diseases. There are a lot of variations to green chutney. We have given below the recipes for green chutney for chaats, faral green chutney, low calories green chutney and green chutney Mumbai style.

Make jowar roti soft of hard depending on how you like it. Jowar is one of the top 5 cereals in the world and is also one of the super foods with many health benefits. We have a very easy recipe using jowar that is Jowar roti also known as \"Sorghum roti\" We have made this healhy jowar roti with jowar flour and little salt to taste. The only trick is kneading of the dough. All you need to do is take required water in a deep non stick pan get it to boil and add jowar flour to it. Mix well and let it cool. Once it has cooled down a little, knead into a soft dough. Make sure the dough has cooled down or you may burn your hands. Rolling the roti requires skills, traditionally jowar roti is rolled using hands but you can also use a rolling pin. Once, the jowar bhakri is rolled, place it on a tava, make sure you cook it on a medium flame flipping both the sides and then cooked on a open flame till it puff ups or until brown spots appear on both the sides. Remove it in a plate and smear with ghee. Jowar roti is super rich in fibre, is gluten free, good for diabetics, heart, weight loss, high in magnesium, iron and also lowers blood pressure and cholesterol. We have used hot water for kneading the dough as it helps in getting the roti soft and even when not served for hours, it doesn\u0027t become hard or chewy. But you also need to make sure that you roll out the roti immediately after kneading the dough as if you would keep the dough for a long time, it will loose its moisture and would become splintery which would make rolling difficult. My grandmother would cook it on an earthen clay oven on a chulha which would give a smoky flavor to the roti. Whenever we cook jowar roti at home, i make any Maharashtrian sabzi to eat along.

Wash long-grained rice (basmati) under running water or in a bowl 2-3 times until the water runs clear and transfer to a deep bowl. Washing helps to remove the extra starch from the rice. 3. Soak the rice in enough water in a deep bowl for 30 minutes. Soaking is very important as it reduced the cooking time of rice. The rice grain will absorb moisture and you’ll be less likely to have broken grain while cooking. 4. Mix well and pressure cook for 2 whistles. Allow the steam to escape before opening the lid. After 2 whistles, you can decide if it requires more or less time as the number of whistles depends on the flame and the litre of the pressure cooker.

Unable to find the bleeding \"black\" carrots, I have substituted them with ordinary red carrots. I often replenish the vegetables in this pickle as they get eaten. Fresh green peppercorns with their stalks can be added if they are in season. This pickle stays well for 8 to 10 days. It will get sour as time passes, you may need to add some sugar as that happens.

However, we do not recommend this pickle on a daily basis in huge quantities. Tips for bhavnagri chilli ka achar. 1. While buying fresh chillies look for crisp unwrinkled ones. Make sure they are bright and unbroken. 2. Cut them into thick roundels so stuffing them becomes easier. 3. IF you are not comfortable stuffing the chillies with a spoon, you can stuff with your fingers as was done traditionally. 4. Store the pickle in a glass jar only.

    "recipeDescription": "Bulgur (which is often referred to as broken wheat or dalia) is the healthiest form of wheat available. The most important nutrient retained by this cereal form is fibre, that makes it a low glycemic index food and helps to prevent a quick rise in blood sugar levels. In contrast, wheat products like rava, maida and pasta lose many of their nutrients as a result of processing and refining. You can also make other nourishing dishes like khichdi and pulao using bulgur wheat. Packed with protein, calcium, vitamin C, vitamin A, iron and fibre, this salad is spiked up with a lot of mediterranean flavours like olive oil, oranges and parsley. Lemon juice and spring onions which will not fail to perk up your spirits. Allow the salad to rest a while after you toss it so that all the flavours mellow and blend yielding into a harmonious flavour.",

      "Place the berry cake on a platter ( slightly larger than the diameter of the cake) on the foam and you have an incredible centerpiece ready.",
      "Making the berry cake is easy. Buy ready-made vanilla sponge from your local baker. Slice it into 3 pieces, horizontally. Sprinkle some sugar syrup to moisten the cake and intersperse it with freshly whipped cream and berries.",
      "We have put the cream and berries only in the centre of the cake. This not only gives the cake a homemade look but it also gives it a smoother, neater finish and makes the finishing touch easier."

    "recipeDescription": "A timeless culinary treasure from the kitchens of Kerala, Puttu is one of the healthiest breakfasts you can think of! Made of steamed rice flour and grated coconut, Puttu has a unique taste and texture, which comes from the special container that it is steamed in. Traditionally, Puttu was steamed in coconut shells but now stainless steel puttu steamers are readily available in shops. Puttu can be made in a cup shape or cylindrical shape depending on the container used to steam it. You just need to make sure that you do not press the flour-mix tightly in the container, but just fill it loosely. If you pack it tightly, there will be no space for air to expand inside the flour and you will end up with hard Puttu. Serve the Puttu immediately after preparation, with a sweet or savoury side-dish. It tastes great with just jaggery and bananas, or can be served with Kadala Curry .",

      "Take the coconut shell, put 1 tbsp of coconut, ¼ of the rice mixture, again 1 tbsp of coconut and ¼ cup of rice mixture and spread it evenly. Make sure you do not press it while filling the shell.",
      "Place this coconut shell over the cooker’s whistle, by inserting it through the hole created, and allow it to cook on a medium flame for 5 to 6 minutes, till you can see the steam coming out of the puttu.",

    "recipeDescription": "A splash of colours and a blast of flavours, all in a stomach-friendly form! This Vegetable Salad with Lemony Apple Dressing is indeed a wonder worth experiencing. Bright and colourful veggies ranging from purple cabbage to carrot and capsicum give you a variety of flavours and textures, while a tangy dressing adds to the taste. Apple is blended with the dressing to balance the flavour and to give it a luscious mouth-feel. Raw vegetables help to alkalize the body and are less likely to ferment in the gut, thus helping to reduce the chances of acidity. Do not make this dressing in advance as it will decolorize. Also try other stomach friendly salads like the Apple Chickoo Salad with Muskmelon Dressing or Cucumber, Bean Sprouts and Apple Salad .",
